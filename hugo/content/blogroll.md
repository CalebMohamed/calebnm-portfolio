I'm really enjoying curating and staying up to date with [RSS feeds][1], I like that
I get to choose what voices I listen to and it all feels so much more manageable and
less manipulative than social media algorithms. To give back to the wonderful minds
that I like to listen to, I've compiled a list of some and why I like them:

[Matt Webb's Interconnected][2] - I mean, he's a bit of a giant in blogging (I was
completely unaware for most of my life and he's my 1st cousin once removed!). I love
his musings on the future and am facinated by the world he sees through his eyes.
Lovely tactile writing, great vision, clean website.

[Westenberg.][3] - I really like how this guy thinks. Sometimes he speaks with too
much confidence for my taste, but he is so honest and sincere that I just keep on
coming back for more (and lets be honest he probably knows better than me anyway).
Regardless, if you want raw, honest takes on work, productivity, and success take
a look.

[Yordi Verkroost's Blog][4] - I think that Yordi's blog really encapsulates what
I want from the personal web: cozy windows into other peoples lives. I love
reading about the mundane moments in his life and all his takeaways and outlooks.
If you want a short and sweet window into a humble and interesting soul check him out.

[Robin Sloan's DragonCatcher][5] - bite-sized highlights of interesting things. I
like his brevity, his gorgeous phrasings and how much curiosity oozes out of his
posts.
