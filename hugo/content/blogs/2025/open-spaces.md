I really like wide open spaces.

It's doesn't come as ecstasy or anything so extreme. Its more a kind of lightness, 
sometimes awe, often a kind of peace. The gentle breeze on the plain; the billowing 
blades of grass in their myriads; the far off simmering of quaking leaves. It's
like I suddenly remember that I was so cooped up. And as with getting out of a tight
space, it doesn't feel like much but that nasty closed up feeling is gone.

Recently, after moving a little further south for my second year at Oxford,
my regular routes to Church and ALDI have suddenly become comparable to
detours along the River Thames and through random fields. 

*"Um... yes sir, doing well sir... I heard that you were selling a little whimsy and 
contemplation 'round these parts? Yes sir... that's wonderful, sir. Now, please give 
me a moment, I just need to fetch a couple minutes from my backpack... there you go.
Pleasure."*

Sometimes I get this really peculiar feeling as I'm walking through the fields:
*"this is really cheeky. I shouldn't be* ***here**** - Oxford students are too busy for
some walks through random fields."*

But I'm never too busy, not truly. Its a choice to remained so cooped up. The fields
are always right **there**. It reminds me how privileged I am to be in this part of
the world. It's all so stunning. I had a walk a month or so ago around my village
at sunset (which I basically never do), and the sky was the most gorgeous lilacs
and flaming oranges. It framed the gravestones in a kind of reverent stillness, and 
all the greenery I walked past just popped in the evening shadows.

I'm reminded of C.S. Lewis' amazing novel [The Great Divorce](1). He has a quote which
really stood out to me and painted a really beautiful picture of heaven:

> I got out. The light and coolness that drenched me were like those of summer
> morning, early morning a minute or two before the sunrise, only that there was a
> certain difference. I had the sense of being in a larger space, perhaps even a larger sort
> of space, than I had ever known before: as if the sky were further off and the extent
> of the green plain wider that they could be on this little ball of earth. I had got ‘out’
> in some sense which made the Solar System itself seem an indoor affair. It gave me a
> feeling of freedom, but also of exposure, possibly of danger, which continued to
> accompany me through all that followed. It is the impossibility of communicating
> that feeling, or even of inducing you to remember it as I proceed, which makes me
> despair of conveying the real quality of what I saw and heard.

I taste a little heaven in every open field. The beauty and freedom; the exposure and vulnerability;
the subtlety of it all and the desire to walk far without end. I long for the world that
turns from it's rebellion and so grows in depth to accommodate (in some sense) its maker. A
world that becomes truer as he is true, beautiful as he is beautiful, wide as he is vast.

Anyways. Please go for a walk!
