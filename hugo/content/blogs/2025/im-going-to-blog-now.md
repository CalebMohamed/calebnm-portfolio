I'm going to blog now.

In my drift through internet land I've stumbled across the beauties of the [IndieWeb][1], blogging and [RSS][2]. 

For most my life, I've been placated by so many various algorithms feeding me content to quiet my thoughts. And I want out. 

Curating the ideas I consume through RSS feeds and trying to produce stuff myself really seems like a way forward. I still struggle with the pull of algorithmic feeds but hopefully as I try to replace those habits I'll find something new and wonderful.

I have loads more thoughts on the 'algorithms' in my life, but I'll get back to the topic at hand and pick that up another time.

Inspired by Matt Webb's [list of rules for blogging][3] I thought that I'd set some ground rules to keep this party going for the long run!
1. Blogs are **weekly+**
2. We play by **friendly rules**
3. One idea per blog
4. Don't edit too much: it doesn't have to be perfect
5. Don't edit too little: respect the reader
6. Don't be an expert: share your uncertainty
7. Don't be a coward: speak up when you're confident
8. No brand, style, or theme: write what you want

**weekly+ -** at least one blog a week (once in each Sunday - Saturday period). I've chosen the old-timey week split so that I'm never rushing to get a blog done on a Sunday.

**friendly rules -** its more important that I continue than I do it perfectly. If I miss a week, *"no worries, we play by friendly rules"*. If I post a blog infested with typos, *"no worries, we play by friendly rules"*. You get the idea.

I started playing by friendly rules when I began writing daily poems. If I missed a day I could write a poem the next morning about that previous day and move on with the 'streak intact'. Similarly if I went to bed super late the poem at 00:15 still counted. This made the momentum much more robust and the point isn't really about the streak at the end of the day.
