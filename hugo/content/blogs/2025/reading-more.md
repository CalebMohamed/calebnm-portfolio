I really love reading. So much so that I find myself estranged from my early years when I'd rather do anything but read.

In books I find other worlds, I find a dialogue with people long passed, I find a medium to make me truly think. But all this literary romance leaves me with a very strange feeling: **I always want to read more**.

I've started to take my reading a bit more seriously and put together a reading list. I've even started ticking off books, but the appetite remains, and maybe even grows.

I feel strangely between worlds. I love detail, precision, definitions and rigorous proofs.
I love the mechanics of abstract machines, the interplay of mystery and curiosity in the search for answers, 
the vast taxonomies and syntax of so many worlds devoid of man. Yet I also love reflections on our common condition,
wrestles with suffering and grief, considerations of purpose and happiness - the seeming 'fluffy' stuff that really constitutes our lives.

Ultimately, these loves unify in my faith which I hope to place at the core of my life and passions.
I love maths because in it I see the beauty of God: his orderliness and genius. 
Computer science, is both deeply mathematical and is also an expression of man's wrestle with power, intelligence and creation.
I truly think that computer science is (or at least can be) profoundly human and an extension of our search for God. 

I love language because I love a God who is articulate in history. A God who paints with galaxies and enters into the great
drama of creation. In the face of God, humanity, our struggles, and our passions become supremely meaningful. I love the
breadth of humanity captured in sacred scripture - the bitter complaint of lament that blooms into worship, the rolling
verses of the psalmists as they reflect upon divine character, the dense theological expositions in the epistles.

What a world to explore.
