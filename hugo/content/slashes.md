Here is a lovely colour coordinated map of all the areas
of my site. Due to some lovely traditions on the IndieWeb
it's called "slash pages" ([what even is that?!][1]).
- Rose is the colour of the personal/base areas of my site.
- Lime is for the areas of my site to do with poems.
- Cyan is for blogs.
- Green is for computer science projects.
- Blue is for professional work.
- Amber is for games.
- Purple is for these **slash pages!**
