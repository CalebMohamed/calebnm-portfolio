A breath gone in and out,
A breath gone in and out,
This deep and fathomless,
Gift of Life and Grace,
To live it to the full,
Enriched and wrecked by no
Greater love I behold,
The goodness of the day,
Is poured out from but one,
Sole benefactor - Father, Friend.

Lord, Lord you are my hiding place,
Though I busy in the day,
You are truer than the Sun,
I behold your glorious radiance,
The image of your breadth.
