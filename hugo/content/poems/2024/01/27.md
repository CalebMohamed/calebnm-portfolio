Eigenvectors,
Do walk along the threads of space,
They see the stars grow old and die,
Yet do not err their course long set,
Such proper fellows marching on,

Where to I ask - where to they know,
They do not share their mysteries,
For in sharing one has walked their path,

Such paths that put such words to shame:
As far, long, weary alabaster,
Shattered early on their very road -

Eigenvectors,
Do walk along the threads of space,
They see the stars grow old and die,
Yet do not err their course long set,
Such proper fellows marching on.
