O shores of time,
I feel you roil the nearing tide,
Fast crash in greedy laps upon the sand,

O shores of time,
I feel your hollowness of old,
Fast crash new tidings gathered in their place,

O shores of time,
I feel you weary bones in hidden depths,
Fast crash in fuzzing sparks among the nerves.

O shores of time,
I feel you march a band out through the sand,
Fast crash when time turns full and the Day is come.
