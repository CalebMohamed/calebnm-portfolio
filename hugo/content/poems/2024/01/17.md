# 17.01.24

Hit the wall,
I peel off like a pancake,
The day is overdone but edible,
Charred dough for battle scars,
Patchy with bitter and sweet,
Covered in syrup for the day is replete.

# Description

Logging for the future:
Dramatically under-prepared for a coding competition.
Really good college aged Christians night (~25 people) in Hove.
