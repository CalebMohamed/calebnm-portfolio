{{< poem >}}
Winter's maw lies unhinged in open air,
Teetering on the edge of snow,
But holding off another day,
If time held fast it'd make it slow,
If seconds passed it'd make them linger.
For liquid frost falls from cruel Winter's fangs,
They seize the earth and drag it down to deepest stillness.
