# 02.01.24

Maths inside a pouring day,
I fill the boards with pen like rain,
Cascading down to pool in merry little fractions,

I fill my mind with tools like water,
That sits pretty until you let it fall,
Through darkest rain clouds down, down,

And strike the earth and make it soft,
From the mud the bridges rise aloft,
The silicon chips from flowing silt.
