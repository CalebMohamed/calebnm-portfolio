{{< poem >}}
The morning sky is blue grey,
Washed out and fuming vapours through its teeth,
It bears them in a contradicting grin,
Down to the rolling clouds below,
Puffs that make the air blue grey and close,
The dew slick grass and open concrete,
Gaze up upon their vaporous host,
And bid him wind when mid morning close,
When mid morning toss his anger with a burst of light,
Vapour clears - the sky more blue less grey.
