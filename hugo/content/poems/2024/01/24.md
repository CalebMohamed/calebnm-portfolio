# 24.01.24

The melody maker,
Plucking the resonaces from the air,
Laying them out in lines and rows,
Making beautiful praises to the lamb,
Drawing out creation into echoed glory,
Bring forth metal pans and plastered walls,
They too shall hum at melody's call,
In praises to the living God,
Sing praises to the living God.
