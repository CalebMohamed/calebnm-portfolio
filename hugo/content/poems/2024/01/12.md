# 12.01.24

For there is one path to wisdom,
Alone in pouring rain and biting frost,
The way the Lord has paved in royal blood,
The mighty of heart tremble at His coming,
His decree is the balm of the meek,
For the Lord remembers His adopted,
He opens the way to wisdom and they shall enter in.
12.01.24
