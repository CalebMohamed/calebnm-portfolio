{{< poem >}}
A cross-legged perch,
The seating position with a timer,
Counting down in fleshy clicks,
Time!!!
A foot falls half asleep.

Alas, farewell you trusty stead and friend,
How far we walked, how far we send,
Our merry little presence beyond,
Past stately trees and murky ponds,
To lands that bustle in the smoke filled air -
Oh, it stopped tingling.
