{{< poem >}}
A moment to stand straight and still,
When all I do is lately run,
Quickly down far alleyways of thought,
Between conversations and the like,
Long streams of wisdom packaged tight,
Until I run down every store,
Of energy to give. Now to recharge,
To gather all my buzz and finish quick.
