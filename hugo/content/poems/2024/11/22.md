If I were accursed,
Perhaps I'd mourn the fall,
Hours down the mountain,
Futile struggles for them all,

Perhaps I'd have no tears to shed,
Eyes dried up and learning lost,
Dashed to dust I shan't become,
But Sysyphus, no, I am he not!

The bounding boulders instil glee,
For now my toil has carried far,
The objects of my strife away,
Down mountain tracks and country paths.
