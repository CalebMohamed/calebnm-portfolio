{{< poem >}}
When tripping makes the fool a sage,
I seem to stumble on a baffling note,
There is lunch without cost - I gauge,
A witness to the loosened lunch,
Unless strong eyes fail and mouth become,
An arid desert, parched beyond profoundly dead,
Empty as to the pit to which it gapes,
Swallowing dreams of dreams of smells,
Too far removed to be as freely mine.
