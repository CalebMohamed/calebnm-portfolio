{{< poem >}}
Am I an actor in the theatre of my mind,
The dusty stage, its weary rebecoming,
I fasten myself an orator twice-lectured,
Ever pacing on the contours of ideas,
Two steps; the echo pierces now the air,
Mere fancy that I sit a playwright, nay,
Each laboured lecture casts my hands
Unlearned, my quill ever wettened,
And my parchment dry.
