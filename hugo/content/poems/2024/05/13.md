The elegance of these reasoned facts,
Expressions in no uncertain terms,
I've come to love to read such symbols,
Cutting to the core of things,
Stripping off obscuring particularities,
Until all that's left is quickened fact,
To which I soar and glide upon,
And make an engine for my mind,
To bolster thoughts and make them run,
To chug along in boiling fluency,
Until the quickened facts cascade,
Into their pretty consequence.
