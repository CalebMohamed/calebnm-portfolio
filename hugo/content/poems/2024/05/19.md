{{< poem >}}
Pull up a chair or rather a sofa to a beanbag small,
To read the open book and become likewise,
To open up in friendship and be read a little more,
A great gift is a band of brothers,
Such is a seed for mighty men to sprout,
The soil for life in all its fullness,
Indeed for life in His name and all its fullness.
