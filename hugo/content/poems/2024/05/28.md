{{< poem >}}
Noodle soup but not the usual kind,
Instead a flowing melody I find,
In it a beauty and complexity,
A challenge and conformity,
An exploration of the frets,
A remark of phrases and their sets,
A little herbs as chords freshly picked,
A little pepper as runs I deftly flicked,
Into the noodle soup but not the usual kind,
Instead I find a flowing melody.
