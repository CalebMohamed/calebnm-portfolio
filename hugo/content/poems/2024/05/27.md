A reason to give praise,
As breath and life and glory of the day,
As heights and dips polish character like jade,
As people in their complex way,
In service and in dancing and in melody beautifully made,
As divine beauty, hope and love,
As salvation and redemption - greater love,
These reasons that I have to praise,
I shall take them up with many at their side.
