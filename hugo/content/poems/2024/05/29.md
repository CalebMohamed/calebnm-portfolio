{{< poem >}}
A journey superposed with steps,
Interweaving 'till it's full and brimming,
Intertwined in conversation or a gentle look,
To green, bustle and horizoned seas,
Out to the olden arches by the streets,
Beyond the humming glow of signs,
That greet the bold faced halls beside,
Then into friends and through the curtain,
Of chattered games and rippled laughter,
Then through these fiery coals by open water,
Into the flowing verbal steps to pleasant places,
As eve begins to sear the sky the steps submerge,
Into the lapping tide and take a turn to deeper blue.
Now hurried to the bustle and the arches,
Interposing with a quickened sight,
The journey home encased in verbal steps,
Until the silence reigns conferred by night.
