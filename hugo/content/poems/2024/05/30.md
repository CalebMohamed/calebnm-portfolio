Colour vision arrayed in hidden rows and spirals
Deep behind void blackness in the eyes,
To hold the light so close and dearly
That it needn't grace again the world outside,
Now cast the land in colour so it drips
With hues and saturation overwhelming,
Turn the petals into memory
The clouds a comfort for the mind.
