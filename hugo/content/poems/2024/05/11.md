{{< poem >}}
Sensitised to all the grubs,
I hadn't seen them in a while,
All bathed in LEDs and pristine paper,
Behind my books and concrete streets,
Far from the simple soil and crawling critters,
Rarely seeing slugs and arching arachnids,

Alas I ventured to domestic dirt,
To the land of green and brown and browner,
To sheer the earthen blanket shorter,
To bare up holes and erect tiny pillars in the soil.
