{{< poem >}}
Putting in a shift,
It falls like rice into the pit,
With wealth of knowledge, practice, time,
All tumbled out of reach into the bleak
Dark recess of this preparation.

But I will see it on the other side,
When all is sifted through to glass,
When gold and silver flow with ink,
Upon the summit of my two year bout,
Where I grappled with my very mind,

And learnt to focus fastened as a hunter,
On problems on a page,
On ordered scribbles in the white.
