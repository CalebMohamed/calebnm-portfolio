Coming into land,
I hearing the rustling curtains at the back,
They beckon me to leave this present act,
The hour glass is vacant of its sand,
Yet I see a tremor leaning into being...
As contours flow down up sideways,
They mirror image full with rushing grains,
All is vapourous unclear in seeing -
The clock is not yet struck.
