# 10.05.24

Rustle no more - for the curtain is behind,
The world applauds in beaming yellow,
I see a sea of faces I haven't known,
But we share a time and moment
In the quiet turmoil of this boiling land,
So full of learning poured on out,
We stare beyond the sea and grass,
To truer sea and sharp horizons,
To trials and tales of valor in this boiling land.
