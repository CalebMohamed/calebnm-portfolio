What spices work with beans?
So many questions for cuisines,
I couldn't tell you where I lean,
So the Dr told me 'Don't be keen.'
'Just grab the ham and fried eggs green!'
But this I say I've never seen,
I wipe my brow and turn to glean,
Why am I the one befuddled mean?
*You* were meant to be Eugene'd,
\- Eugene DeGooseman
