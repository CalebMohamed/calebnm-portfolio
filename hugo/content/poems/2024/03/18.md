Eighteen sum three,
Three units fallen short,
These rocking stones on stones,
Creak out like pestle on their leaning mortar,
Wafting spices short of twenty four,

Alas 
  they 
    crash.

They tumble to the gates of time,
"Wait three rhymes" the clock explained,
"You take up size like hills in delta plains,
It shan't be long to dance with mountains in the rain."
