# 07.03.24

Gandering gooses,
Blank canvases with beaks that always seem to stare,
A chord hanging briefly, unrealised on their exhaled breath,
This dash of orange does sound alarms,
It plasters flashing tape out floating in the air before its face,
"Danger, danger,
I gander until I don't,
I gander until I won't, 
But blast your ears the most,
With goosley chords from blaring horns."
