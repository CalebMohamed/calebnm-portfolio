# 03.03.24

"Accosted by a flippin' fox",
And other such outrageous sayings,
From people I shan't see again,
Except after such a baffling refrain,
These people - where do they come from,
Such perfect strangers' mutterings,
Incomprehensible so respendant gold,
To light the day with exhaled laughs:

"I put it in the microwave,
And that wasn't good,
So just give 'em a pound"
