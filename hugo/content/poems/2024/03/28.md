# 28.03.24

A pseudo-holiday,
Lurks in rippling outer blue,
Casting shadows in open water,
From the expanse I see first its teeth,
Yet then a present in its bite,
Promises of a tussle with reason,
With imperical data sprints and hurdles,
With models of the world and joust,
With proofs and complex facts a toss.
