# 27.03.24

To the day I cry aloud:
You Have Been Had!
And you were none the wiser!
Strolling through the skies and parks,
I saw your meandering by my side,
Yet you saw not my taking breath,
Puff by puff I seized the day,
Each moment ever fleeting till...
I unravelled time itself and stepped on through,
To here where I cry aloud:
The Day's Been Had!
