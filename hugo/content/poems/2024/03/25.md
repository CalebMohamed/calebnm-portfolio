{{< poem >}}
You are the well that never dries,
My thirst is gone yet I can always draw again,
Your spirit is sweeter than honey on my lips,
A refreshment more potent than chilled citrus in the summer heat,
I will ever sing to you for you have lifted my spirit,
And loosed my chains - my hands are light.
