Nineteen sum three,
Two units fallen short,
These towering bricks on brick ,
Grind cement like gum between their layered teath,
Glaring hurried up at twenty four,

Alas 
  they 
    crash.

They tumble to the gates of time,
"Wait two breaths" the clock begun,
"You take up size like filling lungs,
It shan't be long to bear your breath on shanties sung."
