# 21.03.24

Twenty one sum three,
No units fallen short,
These sure layers on layers,
Call out the hum of mountains in their depths,
A summit in line with twenty four,

They
Crash
No
More.

Now rumbled from the gates of time,
"Take heart my little days" the clock called out,
"I told you that with patience you would sprout,"
"With long-suffering firm like rockforms in the rain,"
"With rejoicing hum a deep refrain,"
"With persistence see petitions chime,"
"Like incense in the ruling halls,"
"He made you big though you were small,"
"Now dance with me all through the year,"
"This twenty four is met and overcome."
