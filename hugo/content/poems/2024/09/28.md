# 28.09.24

I fright myself a metal man,
Clung down to bone and copper vessels,
Rust-bitten flowers mark the face,
Blooming to scattered scarlet petals,
Rose flesh beneath sits out of place,
For rust lies faintly though it settled,
With winter though it look so thick,
I shake off now the blooming metal.
