# 12.09.24

Upon a whim to stand on clouds,
Adrift so meekly in their tread,
The world below to cease its sound,
Turn upwards to the layered beds,
Behold low geometry upon it crowned,
Some wispy stairs to fuller threads,
Perhaps I'd think it without bound,
Yet skyward architects betray:
It skirts from the absurd to the sublime.
