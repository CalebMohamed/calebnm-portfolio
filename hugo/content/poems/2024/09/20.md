{{< poem >}}
My Lord most merciful,
Compassionate and regal,
To the heights outstanding,
To the depths fathomless,
I praise you for You're ever good,
May glory be to You,
To the one who makes sense of it all,
The order and the life,
The goodness and the beauty,
The suffering and the pain,
To the one who makes sense of it all:
Have my praise.
