# 16.09.24

Boxing up all manner of things,
Prepositions crammed in boxes,
Labeled and abstracted well,
Taped closed in all manner of reason,
Contracted to their meager symbols,
Implication and necessity split at their seams,
Diagnosed with a case of severe rigor in their application.

Proposition logic!!! Reading about it today.

Let p be the proposition that 'I am writing a poem on my phone', and q the proposition that 'I am tapping on my screen'

If I am writing a poem on my phone, then I am tapping on my screen.

Abstracted as:
if p then q,
or p implies q, 
or p => q,
as q is necessary for p to be true.

This kind of stuff but then going more into depth and looking at many more logical relations and analysing precisely their rules for what statements are logically valid and what logically follows. Questions such as: if q is true what can we know about p? Is not (p and q) equivalent to (not p or not q)?
