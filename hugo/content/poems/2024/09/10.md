# 10.09.24

My oh my, don't you just like
To hurt my head each step I tread,
You show me that the path I walked,
Seems now to fork from just one head,
Serpentine elegance, you fearsome hydra!
A language built from tiny scales of dread,
This fang here seemed so quite complete,
Until you showed me as I read,
It's but a pretty reflection on your scales,

Composite in its consequence.

Learning a language called Haskell and its highly mathematical. 

Concepts and features introduced a few chapters ago are frequently revealed to be themselves expressions of more fundamental rules that I was just taught. 

It really feels like everything in the language is built from something increasingly fundamental and logical but I know that it stops at some point.

It's so fascinating because many languages have keywords and things in which you just take their functionality at face value and then use them, but in haskell some of the common things you use are actually themselves composed from much more fundamental rules and keywords.

If that made no sense to you, my apologies.
