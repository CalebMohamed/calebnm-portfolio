{{< poem >}}
Hanging panels stand attent,
Looking down on passing strangers,
Eating drinking laughing bent,
Encumbered in wafting aromas,
Drawn down into a meal well spent,
Accompanied by passing friends,
Soon scattered, for a moment rent-
Apart, but found again as surely as
The sky returns to vivid marigold after the night.
