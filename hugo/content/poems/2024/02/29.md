# 29.02.24

I found a way to end a month,
Just lie awake until you aren't,
Watch the dusk draw long shadows,
On the walls that deepen into dark,

By now the game is up,
I really wait on Him who holds the clock,
Who sets things in motion as He always has,
The Divine Reason and the Order of Time,

With this the month finds its end,
All things conform to law and pattern,
The night too is orderly in its waking hours,
Turning in when dawn shall rise on morning dew.
