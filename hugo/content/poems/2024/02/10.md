{{< poem >}}
O the sweetness of worship,
Like water to the desert sand,
Sweet honey glowing off the comb,
That fills up your belly with assurance,
*Surely all things are as they should be,*
*Before the throne in spirit and in truth,*
*Surely all things are as they should be,*
*Surrendered at the altar where our Father smiles.*
