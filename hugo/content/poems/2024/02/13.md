{{< poem >}}
Upturning haystacks,
Needles call,
To find the thing that lacks,
So long, thin spike,
A key or pick or pointy sticks,
This needle lost in piling hay,
This needle lost in mounting stacks,
Alas, alas, the needle is stuck sedated in surmounting shambles.
Ah! the needle calls!
A prick upon my finger slack,
It wound its way out from the stack.
