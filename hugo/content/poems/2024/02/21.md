{{< poem >}}
This gift of forming things like clay,
To make as we are being made,
Things to see and hear and play,
All to image us to image Him,
For beauty and for seeking fun,
To see the world between our hands,
See too a world granted us within,
Of desires and dreams and future hopes,
Of sights of unmade things to make.
