{{< poem >}}
I found a new way to sit on a stool,
A single quarter seated,
Three abseiling in the air,
And to level: I'm just kneeling,
With wood legs just right there,
Right behind me upside drifting,
On my calves - so please beware,
I like to wobble this stool neatly,
Until it clatters everywhere.
