{{< poem >}}
T'was a 'stander' on the train,
Two feet below two elbows,
Planted on a wall to lean,
A dauntless task to firm,
The rumbles from the tracks below,
Their depths so close yet in shadow,
Of charging beast,
Of leviathan snaking through the mountain paths,
Through tunnels and past swaying trees.
