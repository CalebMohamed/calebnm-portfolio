Morning walks through livened wood,
The air is crisp and fresh to gasp,
I see the delicate birds fly by,
Ornate wooden sculptures in their hazel coats,
They make another branch their path,
And they roll it out into the air,
They tap the wind and melt into its turn,
These wooden crafts and beautiful things.
