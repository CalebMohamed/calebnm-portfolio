{{< poem >}}
Building blocks to heights above,
I write these laws on silicon slips,
Designed before and tweaked just right-
BUZZ~

Oh is that a fly I hear,
Come to dance about amidst my blocks,
To streak all over private towers,
O come to dance you secret bug.

Then terror turned to vex,
Hive on hive on hill on burrow!
THESE CRAWLING THINGS THAT FILL THE WORLD WITH NOISE,
BEGONE!

Alas, I careless dropped the eggs,
Down deep into my cement,
And now the towers hum,
Come debugger and the printing press,

We shall cast these out and polish jank until it sparkles.
