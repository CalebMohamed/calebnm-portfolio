Walking on the right side,
When daily I walk left the road,
The world unfolds a little changed,
A clearer view to open skies,
The clouds like golden whispers streaking through,
Then purple scars then orange plumes,
It's beauty and its awe at last,
Just from a daily path the same,
Yet its different and I know it too,
Another side unfolded in my eyes,
Another glory refracted through the haze of life.
