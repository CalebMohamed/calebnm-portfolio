Full of family time,
I leave these deeper footprints,
These markings in the shores of time,
For glory and for holiness,
My brothers and sisters make playful shadows,
Dancing mad on softest shores,
They shade the track that must be struck,
With deeper footprints,
These markings in the shores of time.
