{{< poem >}}
Exalted like no other above the heavenly beings,
This great reason and utterance that orders all things,

He is Truth.
He is Beauty.
His path alone is straight,

Come you mighty and kiss the Son,
Follow Him and His Strength won't fail though you fall,
For He is a merciful God,
For He is good.
