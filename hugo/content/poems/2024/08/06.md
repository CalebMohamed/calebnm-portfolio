# 06.08.24

Once again I set out to carve,
A place upon the face of information,
Falling with a vigour as if to starve,
The mind of gaps amidst the murmuration,

To find a dusty cleft to call a far off home,
To set a window looking to the waterfall,
Call out to weary travellers now to roam,
From storefronts to my garden wall,

The rock is thick. I too see why,
So few have ventured carving out a place,
This side of all the petty information lusting for our time.

Trying again to make a personal website I'm happy with, I've tried a few times and given up because it's quite hard due to me wanting to make it from scratch with html, css and js. Maybe one day I'll finish it and send it to you, I hope to one day have a feature where you can easily browse the poems and rate them on there.
