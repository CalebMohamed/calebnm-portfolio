# 10.08.24

With a splash, the pool unveiled,
In pleasant warmness cook the pale,
Cold lines from right besides my eyes,
Under the sun and otherwise,
It's fun and games with those I see,
Just here last year and likely three,
We'll dive and fall and fire off rockets,
Dry off and cast off all my pockets,
The games within to scatter to the carpets whims.
