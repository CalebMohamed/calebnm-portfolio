Taking time to reorganise,
My room for room, undustiness,
For from my youth I heard: be wise!
Clean up your space, don't leave a mess!
I feel a stir and the challenge rise,
For creatures find in piles a nest,
Too beckoned by the order I surmise,
The learnings of my youth are dressed,
Upon my shoulders now -
I hope the fabric's full.
