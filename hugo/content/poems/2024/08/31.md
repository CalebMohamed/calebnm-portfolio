The bastion of these fleeting notes,
Man's autograph crusted in the mold,
Claws up in concrete limbs and cobbled scales,
To kiss the clouds and blue sky's cold,
To praise the trees for all their heights,
More fully praise the blacksmith old,
Of valleys low and churning lakes,
Of fluttered trees and high hills bold.
