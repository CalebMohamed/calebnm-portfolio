# 05.08.23

Tinkered trying at a lock,
Not picking but unscrewing,
Not pinching but in view to fix,
A sagging handle weakly holding,
Alas, alas, the door has been hard nosed,
I cried to Internet he too was lost.
For I know little of the grubby screws,
So little of the things I need,
To convince the barring metal to unloose.
