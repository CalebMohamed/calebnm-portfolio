A rain walk - rain talk,
To bridge the time between, 
Old friends to the shifting hiss,
New friends in view of this
Old sound a texture into sheen,
Turned the world a blackboard and it chalk,

It wrote here in the petals,
It wrote here in the leaves,
It wrote here in the sloping hills,
The hidden stones beneath,

The people they must hear it,
The backdrop of a life under the clouds.
