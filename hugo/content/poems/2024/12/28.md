{{< poem >}}
Along the road through country fields,
Farmers scarce but marking every inch,
The sun rolls dreamy through the cloud,
It breaks over the sheaves of air to grace,
The green with muted highlights meek,
Clinging dearly to the ground - the fog
Hangs durable to waning day yet parts,
To frame the world in vibrant bleeding edges.
