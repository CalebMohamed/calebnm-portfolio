{{< poem >}}
Lazy languages uneager to evaluate,
Cold fusion with an f and finding links
In complete chains away with lists and
Types with kinds in tight constraints but
Crashing down in loops and folds which roll them into mounds.

Sketching out a proof in riddles,
Strawn upon the fever dreams of
Brilliant minds which like to chuckle as
They make their maps of reason and
Find continents submerged in pools of artistry.
