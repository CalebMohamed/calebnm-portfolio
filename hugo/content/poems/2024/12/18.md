# 18.12.24

Dusting off a past-flung puzzle,
Pieces calling out to forgotten homes,
At once a primal pattern match finds a face,
A symmetrical and piercing visage,
Filing itself among the subliminal records of the mind,
Folding from one plane of order to the next.
18.12.24

I was listening to some crazy jazz-funk weirdness for the first time while writing. Allow me... please.
