{{< poem >}}
Draw near to me for I am weak,
Undisciplined I fall astray, but You!
You lift me up from where I slip,
For on the hills You wait in care,
You, tender, seek my fear and love,
For Yours is greater than all strength,
You give Yourself so I won't lack,
Undisciplined I fall astray, but You,
Draw near to me for I am weak.
