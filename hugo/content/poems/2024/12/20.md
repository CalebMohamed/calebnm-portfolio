# 20.12.24

You encourage me with veterans,
Of the way. Still sprinting on,
Encrowned in white and humble patience,
Which seems too scarce in me each day,
You call me on with beautiful bells,
Up to the ornate palaces of your love,
To ancient bells and wisdom's tune,
To where the fount of beauty lies in truth, 
And there the Faithful call me too.
