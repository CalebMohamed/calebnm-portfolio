Inducing all these little proofs,
Scattered constellations self-imposing,
On my mind. Powerfully aloof,
Winks into light at every closing,
Of my eyes. Drawing up a varied booth,

Projecting on its walls the myriads:
Dinner drinks and friendship webs,
Network maps and river beds,
All tumbled out and hung to dry,
'Till underlying threads lay flat.
