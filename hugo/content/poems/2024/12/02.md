{{< poem >}}
Too many pigeons and other such nods -
Such colour to an abstract thought,
The subtle smile that hangs upon a face,
Unannounced at its coming yet lingering as the furniture of the mind,

Funny pictures that we care to draw,
Place fingerprints on the edifice of wisdom,
Nestled in the grooves from ancient hands,
Bearing forth from before time's dawn.
