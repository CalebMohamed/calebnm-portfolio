# 24.12.24

The dusk before the truest dawn,
Which proceeds masterfully each day,
This day of grace and hope for all,
That your dear saviour died for you,
Before you even heard His name,
Before you uttered cries aloud,
He'd stepped into a feeble frame,
To hoist the essence of each man,
Up with himself and through the grave,
So that we'd be forever changed.
24.12.24
