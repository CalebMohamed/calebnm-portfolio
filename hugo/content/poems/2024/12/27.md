# 27.12.24

Flipping through the pages of a manual,
That stretches on until obscene,
Such knowledge careening out in scroll,
At least the page is tagged and unfolds with so many keys.
In rewiring this and that I found:
The heaps of raw complexity,
But peaking with my eyes half closed,
I'll find my fickle balance on this mass of ingenuity,
I'll spot the beast of cogs and know to turn!

Tweaking my Neovim configuration so that I can easily set it up on mu laptop as well.

Neovim is a text editor that runs in the command line. It is highly customisable to the point of madness and there are a ridiculous number of pages of documentation. You can quickly navigate through them due to the nature of Neovim to find exactly what you need to know.

Thankfully you can slowly customise and build up your setup to be perfected suited to your own text-editing needs as it comes with defaults! 

Oh yes I should mention that the main way developers interact with computers is effectively plain-text files. We write in specific languages (c, haskell, lua, javascript, etc) to tell the computer to do things hence the text-editor needs.
