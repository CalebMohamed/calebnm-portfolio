{{< poem >}}
Flipping through the pages of a manual,
That stretches on until obscene,
Such knowledge careening out in scroll,
At least the page is tagged and unfolds with so many keys.
In rewiring this and that I found:
The heaps of raw complexity,
But peaking with my eyes half closed,
I'll find my fickle balance on this mass of ingenuity,
I'll spot the beast of cogs and know to turn!
