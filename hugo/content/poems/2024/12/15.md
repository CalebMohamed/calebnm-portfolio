# 15.12.24

In every trial I see you there,
My Lord in agony and shame,
At the picture of you lifted up,
Just looking I am cured again,
What news is this, this blessed God,
Submit Himself to pain?
The prince for whom all stars daren't stop,
For whom oceans daren't the same,
For whom all the riches fall unworthy,
Drew near to us, in meekness came.
15.12.24
