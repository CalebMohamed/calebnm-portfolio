# 13.10.24

Awesome glory too lofty for me,
Unbottled by words or stained glass,
Poured out in stuttered praises forth,
His loving help and foremost mercy,
Draws out my shame and casts it off,
Though closely now it clings when I do fall,
But by his grace we stand again,
We stand again to one day see our faces new like His.
