{{< poem >}}
A packaged parcel passed on by the postmen in their pristine vans,
What have you here? My very name address and oh!
I must be famous for someone to know my name and gift me this!
Alas it was just I who parted with a pretty penny,
Alas it was just I who petitioned the postmen now to post,
From out away in teeming warehouse,
From out beyond where I have known,
A packaged parcel passed along to find purchase and here preside.
