{{< poem >}}
Politics made a dance upon a stage,
Become debate then farce then prattled on with age,
Oh please just talk along a line!
Not skew or stiff or boundary but beside,
Clear judgment - close its bedside table,
Make friendly with integrity what's stable,
You lead this place at least in part,
May He guide you though you do depart,
From gentle ways and humble paths,
I trust He'll be to you a staff
behind the scenes or by his grace in open air.
