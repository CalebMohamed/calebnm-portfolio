{{< poem >}}
And suddenly, a sudden tree!
Placed grown and full just by the path,
In all its hefty trunk and sprawling roots,
Made homely with a band of friends,
Arrayed in summer outfits neatly greened,

A sudden tree in wilting soil,
Cut back for weeds and left to plead,
For something lively in the wake,
Of cold hard soil and hardly friends,
But now the path has found a pleasant pause in roaring streets.
