# 14.06.24

Hidden in the perfect man,
What glory far too good for me,
To know my God as father now,
To know my God would purchase me,
What glory far too good for me!
That He would nurse my sickness through,
That He would hold me close when I am cold,
What glory far too good for me,
Forgiven when I pain my soul,
Comforted when myself dismay.
