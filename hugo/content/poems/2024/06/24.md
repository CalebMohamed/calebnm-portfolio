An easing snap and scattered to the ground,
The finish line cast gently down,
Some raucous now I do not find,
At the buzzing end of speeding mind,

The Sun is fiercly in the sky,
With passion as I said goodbye,
With passion that I fail to clasp,
Instead a steady smile far milder that I seem to grasp.
