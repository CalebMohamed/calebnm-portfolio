{{< poem >}}
Small of a kind,
The little ones and their massive eyes,
Their attention held but for a breath,
And in the next they're off again.
Down the train of thought you think,
Until you see your solemn face as silly,
They hadn't known just half your words,
And in the next you're off again,
To join in the hilarities of an alien world.
