# 03.06.24

Why not make the vastness of this age,
The information age a chessboard for the mind,
A racetrack built on hyperlinks and eons,
Of collective time - the toil of archivalists,
Why not test a naive lens upon the links,
To see how far this youthful sight will carry you between,
To take in fragments of a fact to spur you onwards to the goal,
Just time before the other finds the same.

# Description

Racing my friend on Wikipedia linking challenges - you both start on the same Wikipedia page and have to navigate to another arbitrary page, by only using hyperlinks - although you can go back if you don't like the path you chose. It's a nice mix of general knowledge strategy and skim-reading.
