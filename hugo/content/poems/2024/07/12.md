{{< poem >}}
Oh distant wings upon the lower sky,
I hold my ear up to your distant whine,
The evening rumbled in your song,
In swaying air the deepened line:
  Away away to farther field,
  Drag dust and soot sojourning,
  Come cast beyond the surging sea,
  To trembling mounts and valleys vast,
  Span skies beneath the setting sun,
  Grasp grandeur till your heart humbles,
  Away away be swept into an awed applause.
What glory crying from the world,
What depth and height a gift of love,
What wisdom vast unsearchable,
What majesty that seeps into each blade of grass.
