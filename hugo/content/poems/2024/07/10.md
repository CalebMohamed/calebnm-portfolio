Unorthodox algebra, quite did you say?
The symbols that I've know,
Are different but the same,
Struck out from shows,
My methods without legs lie lame,
I see! Just wait! and give me time,
I'll find upon the rhyme a game,
And in the game a dashing rhyme,
To give me legs to rule and reign,
Algebra unorthodox but delightful I do say.
