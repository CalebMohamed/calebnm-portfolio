{{< poem >}}
Baring down the hall and all its painted legions,
The puzzles hanging shattered in the dance of glass,
A hard face and fearsome sheen,
That turns from help to hidden blade,
That cuts the puzzle and opposer: I,
A fallen ringing deep within the ears,
A splitting pain from raking every corner of the mind,
The legions stand today but some lie fallen with the glass.
