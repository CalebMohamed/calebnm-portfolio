{{< poem >}}
Shopping in a nowhere store,
A far gone world beyond a screen,
Silent in its ever weighty expansion,
Until I hear the chatter of a far away tongue,
Perfect strangers who have given words,
For me to weigh and test their worth,
To hasten my departure from this realm,
My pockets sitting higher in my trousers.
