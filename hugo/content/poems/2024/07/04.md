{{< poem >}}
In scathing light of problem puzzles,
To taste defeat but cry: just yet!
This very day I fall but I will stand,
Another morn' the puzzle banished from my eyes,
In clarity cast upon the mast of darling reason,
Bearing fast upon the storm until I'm through,
Just yet! I will see the problem through.
