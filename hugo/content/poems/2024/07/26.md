# 26.07.24

Filling up my head with lead,
Rising just above my cheeks,
Under my eyes which bearing
Too much weight fall bagged down,

I thought it'd fall instead but
Nay, it rose again to Thee,
The temple of my skull encasing,
The temples whence I hear a cry:

Hold stalwart firmest walls upon,
The weathered mountain face beneath,
Grab buckets old and young men place,
The springs upon this ceaseless fire.

You shall not taste our hidden fields,
Our gardens make our bodies walls,
Watch on you foulest scourge and hear,
The water quenches fire but passion not!
