{{< poem >}}
A world of websites,
Biding until you enter in,
To windows flush past stoic links,
To easing shapes in warming light,
Great gradients! 
Great lines understated,
Great logos, symbols, tactile sights,
This world so rich in meaning,
Rich in time and care and skill,
A world I knew but never in this sight.
