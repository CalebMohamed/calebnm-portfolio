Refactoring my olden lines,
I file them neatly into boxes,
Labelled clearer, cleaner, concisely,
A little here goes there,
Much can go for good and more,
Like purest puzzles every moment,
Warping shifting into line,
A pleasing buzz of brainwork -
Not too heavy on the cells,
But light enough to have me dialed.
