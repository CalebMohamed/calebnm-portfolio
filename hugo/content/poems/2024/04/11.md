# 11.04.24

Refactoring my olden lines,
I file them neatly into boxes,
Labelled clearer, cleaner, concisely,
A little here goes there,
Much can go for good and more,
Like purest puzzles every moment,
Warping shifting into line,
A pleasing buzz of brainwork -
Not too heavy on the cells,
But light enough to have me dialed.

# Description

Refactor - restructure (the source code of an application or piece of software) so as to improve operation without altering functionality.

Clarity: I was reorganising a refactoring some of my game code today, 'twas very enjoyable.
