I'll have a poem - two to go!
Please sprinkle in the crazy words...
Like jazzfunkle.
The kind that gives the impression of...
Something rambotent but that never holds a glass -
Of water, never solid but a vapour,
Of something hazy yet familiar.

The beating heart thrums loud unsaid,
From a beckoned chest - an urge to dance, 
No, nod your head, your feet like lead,
The world is quiet listening still,
To unlyrics from jazzfunkle's quill,
Deeper than you know is you,
Yet you it is, for you see you move,
Your face turns sombre even stern,
To chew on rambotent lines and turns.

Nonsense poems what a laugh,
I see you puzzling at my path,
Its more than fun to walk on through,
I guess from over there I'm quite kookoo.
