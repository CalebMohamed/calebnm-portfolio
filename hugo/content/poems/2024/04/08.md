{{< poem >}}
Clear out all you with your semantic antics,
This whole operation is reaching critical mass!
Too many poems to search and remember,
Too many poems to contain in one moment,
It's semiotic folds cry halt at the onslaught of words,
Yet this foreboding marks the end,
The symbolic degeneracy pressure falters on its knees,
I hear the rumblings of the end -
A supernovella is upon us!
Pooooooooooommmmmm.. .  .   .   .
