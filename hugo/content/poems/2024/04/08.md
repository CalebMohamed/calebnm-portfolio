# 08.04.24

Clear out all you with your semantic antics,
This whole operation is reaching critical mass!
Too many poems to search and remember,
To many poems to contain in one moment,
It's semiotic folds cry halt at the onslaught of words,
Yet this foreboding marks the end,
The symbolic degeneracy pressure falters on its knees,
I hear the rumblings of the end -
A supernovella is upon us!
Pooooooooooommmmmm.. .  .   .   .

# Description

Stars when they get big enough compress under their own weight to the extent that they force the electrons in the nuclei to enter the nuclei themselves (instead of orbiting around). These electrons aren't a fan of that and so something called electrons degeneracy pressure must be overcome by gravity for this to happen. If overcome the star undergoes a supernova.
