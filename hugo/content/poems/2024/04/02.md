{{< poem >}}
Outside a misty dress this April rain,
Ebbs light and soft upon the window pane,
Drapes fit the form of day in ponderous grey,
Then frills of light and weaving spikes array,

Pretty flowers upon glass leaves do sway,
Take firm the droplets for a coat to stay,
The wind a brash caress that turned away,
Found solace by the bulwark - April Rain.
