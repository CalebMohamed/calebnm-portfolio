{{< poem >}}
Old Shakespeare once told me,
He saw a man to the chaps unseamed,
Wait no - He was simply just privy,
To the musings of his quill and ge-
-nius a depth of meaning forcibly,
Made known in plays that march like poems.
Oh, I forgot to tell you that it's me,
You probably guessed it:
You've been Eugene'd,
About that incident yestereve,
I took a supernovella in my arms,
Wiped my brow and steeled my calm,
I ran into the depths of mind to watch,
The flash of definition in the pan,
A light of symbol in the dark,
I watched it delve into the lines of space,
Unseam it's deepest meaning to the chaps,
How did I return to tell the tale?
Do I not look like Mr E. DeGooseman to you?
\- Eugene DeGooseman
