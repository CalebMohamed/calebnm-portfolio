# 04.04.24

Three of fours,
Make way for two,
At least there's only one,
But gladly it is half of four,

A language that does dance in lines,
That makes the numbers merry acts,
That turns itself in knots to do
A magic trick in metred step,

What gift it is this language broad,
It's cry I heeded: All Aboard!
So now it's mine a gleaming sword,
Cut gems of phrase I can't afford.

# Description

The last line is quite meta, because I couldn't afford all the required syllables to write what I was going to originally. Consequently, it makes less sense, and if any sense at all, a sense about another thing entirely.
