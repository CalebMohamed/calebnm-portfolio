# 15.04.24

Deeper, deeper blue,
Like evening sky in waning winter,
When the sky is thick but lighter,
A rolling scene of scattered hue,
Absent of stars or sun or moon,
Alone the wind a hallowed tune,
Comes drawn across the sky in lieu,
Makes firm the navy waves,
Marks out a flashing bright enclave,
A whistle in the deeper blue.
