{{< poem >}}
There's still sand in my face,
Still dust crusts in my eyes,
It flickers to starlight on the sea,
What gorgeous geometry.
Framed pebbles in their flowing waves,
Like gemstones in bezels embed-
ded in my feet until they're red,
Next pebbles turn to pat my back,
A friend of rocks -
False friends with rocks,
Convent how they end up there,
At least I hear their laughter all the same.
