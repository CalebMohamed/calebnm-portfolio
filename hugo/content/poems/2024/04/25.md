# 25.04.24

•- •--• --- • -- in morse code,
Half a language for my abode,
To bare my memory full strength,
On characters two: briefness and length,
Twin summits verbose and universal,
In text or falling snow, a tapped rehearsal -
The pitter patter on the peaks,
The flashing lights and mouth-made beeps,
So I present to you an olden road,
•- •--• --- • -- in morse code,
25.04.24
