# 19.04.24

Poemise the day,
In parcels packaged with pensive thought,
Partial rhymes I posed and sought,
Then I plucked without delay,
Full rhymes and riches from the air,
Plumes and dust from a slow care,
To nurse a slowly day,
At once it quickened,
The cold air thickened,
All is hot and frantic on the way,
A chattered greeting into tustles,
Softballs landing squarely by the hustles,
Always good - great fun to play.
