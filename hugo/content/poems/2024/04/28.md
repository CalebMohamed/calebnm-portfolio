{{< poem >}}
A hearty pangram steaming on the stove,
The ancient stew dear to typographers,
Lifeblood of font soldiers and marching sets,
A tale to span the breadth of language yet,
To hold the gaze - transfix philosophers,

Why did the slight brown fox run quick?
Why springly jump into the midnight air?
Why chase the lazy dog while good stars sleep?
And bar them peace to bask in silver glow?
