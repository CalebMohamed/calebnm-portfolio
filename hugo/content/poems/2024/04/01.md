The April Fool - a merry antic in the flesh,
Yet I only saw his shadow in the day,
Just a whisper of his name,
No fish or crying laughter all the same,
Alas I'll tell of this symbol olden,
The April Fool scratched tin to golden,
A spoon to sharp and edged knives,
A fellow needy of nine lives,
Pity he is all but a cat -
A Fool, a jolly April Fool instead.
