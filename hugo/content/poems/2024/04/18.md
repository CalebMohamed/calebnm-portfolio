Word gaming and semantic framing,
For fried physics brains and friends,
They make good company and strike up a dance,
Upon a slow stuttered train that halts and stops,
Starts again to see the dawn of play,
The dawn of something given laughter and lightness,
To find a piece of what is human in the learning,
To see the fun in semantic framing,
To see the good in closeness born from play.
