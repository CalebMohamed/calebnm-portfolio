Glowing lights adorn the tree across the road,  
Exuberant fairies blinking in cold blues and warm oranges,  
Its trunk flows seamlessly out from its roots,  
And holds the little fairies with care.  
  
A street light stands to attention,  
Watching the cool streets with a fiery gaze,  
It towers like a bastion,  
Bearing the frigid darkness and halting its charge.  
  
They seem to silently speak,  
Their feet encased in the earth,  
They remain still.
