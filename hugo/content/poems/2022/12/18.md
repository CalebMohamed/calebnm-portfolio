{{< poem >}}
As the orange lights bathe these teal chairs in citrus waves,  
A lulling rattle flows unending through the carriage.  
  
We sit face to face,  
Speaking of the simple and complex.  
  
Young travelers sojourning in a distant land,  
After recharging with our own.  
  
All mysteries are our Lord's,  
The hiding place of knowledge and wisdom are bare before him.  
  
Over time we will know,  
He will share with us the simple and the complex.  
  
And into eternity we shall laugh and learn.
