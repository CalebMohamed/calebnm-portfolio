{{< poem >}}
Gorgeous food,  
And gorgeous friends,  
Sit around me at the table,  
Some battered and bruised,  
But for the meanwhile happy and stable,  
Others ready to love,  
And sprinkle some salty salt,  
And shine some gracious light,  
For a high priest stands with the bruised in his sight,  
And the awestruck lovers in his heart.
