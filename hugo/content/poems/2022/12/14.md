In the window, I see him,  
Staring back at me,  
His eyes on my eyes,  
Light brown and deeply curious.  
  
I follow the bump of his nose,  
And ring his eyes along the momentary wrinkles,  
They seem to dig in and lie still.  
  
I blink and they remain,  
Young mind and an old face,  
Old mind and a young face,  
A tension to tell the both of us that we are citizens of another land.  
  
A land where wisdom comes to the humble fool,  
And decay remains the side character in the story of a great salvation.
