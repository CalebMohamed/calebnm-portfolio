{{< poem >}}
Gravity tugs on my core,  
A thick lifeline,  
A tether leaving me sore,  
But all the more safe and secure.  
  
Grounded and humble,  
It makes me bow down low,  
Refining my temperament,  
And training my muscles under my own load,  
And then a little more,  
And then a little more.  
  
They call it stewardship.  
It's pretty cool.  
  
Help me to be humble and to steward well all that you give me, Lord.
