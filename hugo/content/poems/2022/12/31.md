Another year’s past,  
A large slice of 16,  
With a little more pepperoni on it than previously,  
Covered in the small moments and quite a few big ones too.  
  
It had a warm tomatoey base,  
Rich with family and godly brothers and sisters,  
Yet it was oh so spicy,  
It seems that the master chef insisted.  
  
It was a good one,  
And it appears that I am three fifths more now,  
Stretched, rolled and risen in Christ,  
But seriously he’s always pulling though.
