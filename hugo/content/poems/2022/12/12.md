I am undone,  
An unravelled ball of yarn,  
In moments of silence you put my heart on like a glove,  
Flowing by in a torrent,  
Of sorrow and love.  
  
To my left and to my right,  
They curse God and die,  
Out of pain,  
Out of spite,  
They whisper and scream it,  
Cursing and deem it,  
Justice.  
  
Your heart burns against injustice, O Lord,  
Your gaze detests the darkness,  
The stark darkness of their blindness,  
You, my Lord, are a jealous God,  
How long will your children sit in graveyards of shattered pottery?  
  
I am undone,  
An unravelled ball of yarn,  
Purify my heart.  
  
I am undone,  
An unwound fishing line,  
Wash away my filth in crimson blood,  
And cast me out into the waters.
