{{< poem >}}
Wide eyed and stupefied,  
I wonder and quake,  
I revel and mumble,  
Awed in his wake.  
  
He's glorious, you see,  
Good and oh so gracious,  
He's precious to me,  
His house is oh so spacious.  
  
So revel and quake,  
Come with me, sit still,  
And honour his name,  
He is worthy of praise.
