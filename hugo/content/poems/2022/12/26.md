{{< poem >}}
Winding down,  
I hear the water flowing through the pipes,  
A little sizzle and drizzle,  
A warm rush for the night,  
To stay warm in my covers - so cozy,  
I'm a little drowsy now,  
Lights off and breathe slowly.  
  
A little breath in my lungs,  
Gratefulness in my soul,  
Off to bed - I climb the rungs,  
And the night slips in.  
  
A simple dream sits in the periphery.
