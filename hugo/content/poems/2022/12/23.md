Light pings and flickers off the obscured glass,  
As the flowing pattern wobbles across its surface,  
Dancing around the reflection,  
Telling myths about the reality behind.  
  
It sits peacefully,  
Hemmed in between the walls,  
Gazing into the dark sky,  
Peeking at the warm floor beside.  
  
The light continues to glimmer and bounce off the warping pane.
