Oh what’s that,  
It seems I’ve got maths in my mind,  
It speaks of a great design,  
The language of all creation,  
He speaks the particles into motion,  
His mind behind the oceans,  
And every star and every orbit,  
To the cool rush from a lovely sorbet.  
  
Oh what’s that,  
It seems I’ve got maths in my mind,  
As I sit and try to rhyme,  
He sits in the depths outside of time,  
Thinking every fold of reality before even a sign,  
Calculating the very sublime,  
And placing his word in the flesh of mankind.  
  
It was the greatest outpouring,  
Far more than when He poured numbers into the chaos,  
Far more than when He drenched the land in purpose,  
Far more than when He carved his image into the dust,  
All of it into meek flesh,  
To shatter the chains of death.
