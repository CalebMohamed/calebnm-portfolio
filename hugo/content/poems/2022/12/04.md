Walking slowly,  
Is a great pleasure of mine,  
To breath deeply,  
And gaze at the world through eyes that shine.  
  
Often I am walking quickly,  
To a lesson,  
To a train,  
To a service,  
To my home again.  
  
I like the moments when I can walk slowly,  
To take in the sights,  
And watch the many people passing by,  
People are quite beautiful, right?  
  
Slow and quick,  
Humble and proud,  
Growing and in step with old patterns.  
  
There's great hope for them,  
Someone's nocking, you see.
