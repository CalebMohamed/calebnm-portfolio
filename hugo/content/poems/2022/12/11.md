Underneath the radiant stars,  
An embassy from a land afar,  
Pulses like a heart,  
A great house of the lord - an upstart.  
  
A rebellion brews,  
Against the unflesh and bloodless,  
Against the darkness that spews,  
Against which their Lord has won.  
  
So they shall pulse,  
And beat and drum,  
To stir up a great chorus,  
And sing of mercy and justice.  
  
Their radiance is blinding,  
For their light is a holy light,  
The very light which broke their binding,  
The very Son of Man with highpriestly might.  
  
So sing and dance,  
And dance some more,  
Their saviour's won,  
He can be yours.
