{{< poem >}}
Christmas eve,  
And I'm not feeling Christmas-y,  
But I got some peace and some joy,  
And some smile-y,  
Siblings dancing with me up on the attic,  
Running amok with a dance not static,  
Not stationary, just moving and having fun,  
Till tomorrow brings celebration,  
And praise to the blessed Son.
