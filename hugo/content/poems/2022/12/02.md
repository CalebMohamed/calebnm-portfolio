A sleepyleb lounges,  
Enchanted by the prospect of no more commutes,  
And much less muchness.  
  
The daily clamour is a racket three times more than not,  
Its a great dance and parade,  
Great fun and great games.  
  
Nevertheless, after work comes great rest,  
And after rest great fun.  
It's the natural rhythm of things.
