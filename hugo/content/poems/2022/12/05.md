Blood combusts and rages through my arteries,  
It boils forth,  
At once tame and hiding a primordial temper.  
It rises to the surface dancing,  
Through the veins and down my legs,  
It stalks and cycles in a timeless prowl.  
  
One step,  
Two step,  
Green light,  
Green light.  
  
I run unfettered,  
The concrete slapping my soles in retaliation,  
As I run without restraint,  
As I run a fool and sage,  
As I run to spite the clock.  
  
As much as I like to run with these long legs,  
And decorate my rush with a flourish and twirl,  
He gave me these fine legs of mine,  
And turns the red lights green,  
For tired feet to tread.
