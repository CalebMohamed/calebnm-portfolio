{{< poem >}}
Quietly now,  
Rush off to the silent land,  
And hush your merry twittering,  
For the stillness of today will end by the morning,  
And the dawn will kiss your eyelids awake.  
  
So go quietly now,  
Rush off to the formless place,  
Where you shall see and unsee,  
Laugh and unlaugh,  
And leave your past in the author's hands,  
Stepping onto the other pages.  
  
Go quietly now, my child,  
Drift off to the consoling warmth,  
Its time to lay your failures to rest,  
They don't follow you into the author's arms,  
He has new lyrics for your heart,  
And new dawns for your smile,  
So leave them in the gentle waves.  
  
He awaits you in the quiet place,  
And holds out His arms with deft and grace,  
To rap you up and make you smile,  
To hold you close,  
And still your restless heart.
