Your melody walks swiftly over the horizon,  
Dancing playfully under the waves,  
Treading firmly through the glaring eyes of hurricanes.  
  
It crawls, walks and scuttles among the humble things,  
And soars above the lofty heights,  
Reverberating through valleys and rocking the earthen cradle.  
  
It flows through the sky waters,  
Permeating the three heavens,  
And ploughing into the depths of sheol.  
  
It is boundless,  
And sans time it glided other the formless,  
The beautiful symphony of your presence is now within us.
