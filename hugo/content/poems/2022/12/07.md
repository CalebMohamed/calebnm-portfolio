{{< poem >}}
Broken shoe,  
Unbridled joy,  
A little less serious,  
A little less 'mysterious'. 
  
O broken shoe,  
How does it feel,  
To peel back and flop,  
To break and kneel,  
  
To be tread on,  
Yet yield,  
And support my weighty soles,  
Through mire and field?  
  
O broken shoe,  
Unbridled joy,  
I take myself a little less  
Serious...  
Maybe a little glue will hold you together?
