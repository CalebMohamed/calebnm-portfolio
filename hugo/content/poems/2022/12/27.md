{{< poem >}}
Fake cash lies chaotically on the joyous cloth,  
Colour and money splayed on the table,  
A little card here and some metal figures there,  
All is awash in laughter and cheering.  
  
The bruised and battered sit as friends,  
For friends they are,  
Deep friends,  
True friends.  
  
And friends theyâ€™ll stay,  
For salt and light love to sit and be,  
Good friends with them,  
For they were made beautifully.
