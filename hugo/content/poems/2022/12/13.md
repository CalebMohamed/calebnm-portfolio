A soft crackle of snow,  
Chases my shadow,  
Dancing under the chilly pale light,  
And waltzing with my shoes.  
  
A cool breeze,  
Caresses my nose leaving it red,  
And sleepy clouds seem to fall off their axes,  
Down, down into the waking land below.  
  
A quiet walker,  
Trudges on to his home,  
A faithful friend limps beside,  
It's not a long way now.  
  
How he loves him.
