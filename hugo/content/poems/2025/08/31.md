A world of other minds obscured,
By thick conveyor belts, industrial queues,
By automated baits and hidden cages,
I've almost had it with the thing! I'm through.
But here I find a dusty tact,
The molten microphones of old,
These here are real thoughts,
These here are real minds in bold.

Building an rss feed, where you collate blogs you want to follow (all open source, no ads, all personally curated). So much better than social media algorithms, the format also feels so genuine. Its nice to get shown new stuff from social media algorithms but I don't like the level of influence it has on me and how it's always trying to appeal to my impulsive attention.
