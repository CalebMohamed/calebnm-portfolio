It's been a while since I have mused,
On writing all this poetry,
But feeling dry, somewhat confused,
I turn to such a trusty tree,
"I've carved so many pages from you now,
Old oak of my prolonging ponderance,
We've seen the flowers and their fields in blue,
The far flung hills and precious starlight coats,
We've looked upon all manners of the race,
Those close and far perfected strangers, such,
Joyed saints in silver crowns and rosy cheeks,
I've seen myself become so changed, old oak,
And you so riddled now with words, my words."
