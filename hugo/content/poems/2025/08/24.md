I call You Great Comforter, friend,
The standing rock in splashing seas,
All else is deathly deep but you,
On you I find my feet. My feet,
Shall never falter this I know,
For you are firm though all else moves,
And even time finds pause in you.
And even stars find night in you.
And even stones find songs in you!
And even I'll find peace in you.
