The quiet of an open field,
Is no quiet quite at all,
But something more, something fuller,
It's the carried chatter of the birds,
The sliding of the wilding grass,
The transient wind which always seems to hang about such places -
I wonder why I ever filled it when I ought participate.

Wonderful walk with Dad. God is so glorious his majesty runs through the depths of all creation.

Just got my website working online and accessed it on my phone through data which is external access!!!
