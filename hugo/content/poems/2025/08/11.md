{{< poem >}}
Coastal ways make running paint,
A mural smeared through breaking pace,
The land and sea all fall to gorgeous colour,
Holding but a semblance of their passing form.

And here as colours run, we meet,
Pure strangers who we seek to be,
With some kind of passing form in sight,
A light for them. A colour and a love.
