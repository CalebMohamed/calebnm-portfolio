{{< poem >}}
Troubleshooting blanks the bullets blindly bounce off,
The rubber that they are asserts the duel is up,
And I walk out alive the ring behind, 
The street deserted, horse abandoned by,
So turning I look separate ways at once,
Stumble on a lesser thing not quite the,
End to trouble but a mere compromise.
