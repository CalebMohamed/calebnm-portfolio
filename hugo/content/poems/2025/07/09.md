The golden eye's descent in awe,
To watch the swallowed world in black,
Becomes exalted tiger quieting,
The haze. Setting the limit of shadows,
Who will hold it fast? Who will stay its sight?
Who will draw the limit on its awe,
Blunt claws to make of it a watchman?
Surely there descends a greater gaze,
Commanding the deep hidden awe,
Subsuming every cosmic dance,
Transcending every light until it dwells in each.
