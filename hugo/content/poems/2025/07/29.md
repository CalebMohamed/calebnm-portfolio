{{< poem >}}
Such varied and beloved saints,
Walk with me in haphazard rise,
Pearly bared teeth and joyous bounds,
Upturned lips, wise wrinkled eyes,
That swallow me in faithful love,
That mark a kinship cutting through,
The deepest differences to find,
A wounded king that bridges to,
Such varied and beloved saints.
