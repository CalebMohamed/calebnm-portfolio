The heavens' treasuries are bust,
Unseamed they spill twice over all,
So formless lose all measure of restraint,
And we are made too rich.

I think Rachel's into this guy Issac who we met at camp. Again though I probably have no idea given my track record.  Struggling with insecurity when the other guys do crazy stuff and make funny jokes. I don't feel funny and I don't feel like myself. Rachel keeps on making comments about me being stressed or perfectionist, I obviously could be blind to it but I'm pretty sure she's reading it wrong. I think I've been pretty calm and I just want to make sure that we're all looked after and that things don't go really really wrong. Definitely praying a lot about this stuff, my emotions are a bit of a mess.

We swam in the lake again today but I got so cold that I had to get out. It was pretty painful, and I felt quite lonely as they were still having fun in the water why I was trembling violently.

Absolute insanity, girls' tent is soaked, they migrate to ours.
