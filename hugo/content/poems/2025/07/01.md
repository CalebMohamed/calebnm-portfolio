Slip-ping on another face,
The former falls in shreds,
The categories of youth,
Tug - firmly at my sharp gaze.

Is a man within his hair?
Within his strength and stride?
Is he found in his eyes?
Or - met in his deepest care?

Though I change to a new face,
My mind is held the same,
So samely holds my look,
Sub-verting each change I see:
The same man quickly in the glass.
