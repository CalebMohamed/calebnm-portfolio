{{< poem >}}
Free-diving headlong into books,
A studied act of co-creation,
So seeing through the other's eyes,
Placing their tongue upon your breath,
You build the worlds they sketch.
You greet their take on man.
You see a glimpse of them:
Their hope their faith and wanderings
Through this same puzzled life.
