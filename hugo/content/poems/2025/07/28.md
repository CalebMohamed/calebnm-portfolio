Steady over sun-kissed fields,
The Lord deals mightily with me,
Firm seat of all the fears I yield,
What heights to which He cares for me!
Again I fall so stricken weak,
So full of little weariness,
But here a brother! This I seek,
Who tells me that the Lord's done more with less,
Who speaks to me the grace that we do share.

Jeremy Bunce convo today, humility in doctrine, brethren and church unity, women in ministry, what God does in countries without all of our fancy and 'proper' modes of church, the centrality of the gospel, the long term plans for our lives, the humility and faith to be unsure where the Lord is taking us, the patience to wait for the time, encouragements on character and how he could see me going into ministry.
