In passing moments of the day,
All manner of those homely hums,
Intrude upon the fabric of the mind,
Becoming all the static of its wires,
Decaying into shattered thoughts,
They are too fast, too low, too wide,
Too sad but through them is a sort,
Of tempering the heart.

I don't think Rachel likes me. I don't know if this Thomas guy is dating but just on reflection I don't think it's reciprocated.
