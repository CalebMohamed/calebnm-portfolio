{{< poem >}}
Our numerical nomenclature,
Our open love letter to reason,
A muse, a confidante, a precious gift,
The infinite and divine thread through,
The simple, mundane, and immediate,
Lofty geometry and imminent counts,
The squares that dance within our sight,
Tickle at the foretaste of perfection,
And draw upon a silly smile: five five -
The perfection between the hands.
