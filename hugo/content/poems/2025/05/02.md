{{< poem >}}
Radiant streets are emerald at once,
The frailties stagnation left to thaw,
Its place the darling stone is clothed again,
High arches with cascade wisteria,
Your streets are full and radiant great ox,
A glory lent and spent that you would turn,
To your first love, your strength and founding light.
