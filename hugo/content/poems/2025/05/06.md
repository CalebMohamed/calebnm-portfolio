{{< poem >}}
Torn finger pads ashore in foaming rings,
Dashed in and all upon my frantic surge,
To mastery and melody the hope,
That I would fall again away in time,
Leave all the music from my soul in place,
Sharpen such thoughts beyond the measure of,
The mind, that it would simply play the strings.
