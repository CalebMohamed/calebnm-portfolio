Ever the strange pictures beside the views,
The tremors of the past made mute in death,
An iconography of old disused,
Becomes bewildered to comedic dread,

Why so many wings, why?
Scales, winding robes for what?
What proverbs did apply,
Within these jovial eyes and solemn lips?

Your blatant words are kept,
Your characters find few,
But who can know the depths,
I find the veil of time is truly shrewd.
