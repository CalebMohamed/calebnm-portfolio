What good is had in evil ways?
If turning to so frail a gain would not delay,
If it could lead you to the end of man,
It'd simply swerve to all that's true:

The pave to it is slick with unity,
Up through all power, knowledge, wealth,
Through every good to high glory,
To happiness where all is one, and there divine:

The truly happy - man's own end,
Cannot be had in paths that turn away,
For truly in the act man comes a beast,
He is dissolved, far from the Lord his nature seeks.
