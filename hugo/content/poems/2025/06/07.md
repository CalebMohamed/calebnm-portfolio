Droplets on the glass descend,
Tell a tired tale too told,
But perhaps it is for good?

Their transience is spent in wealth,
Prismatic they do taste each hue,
Put on the storied melodrama,
Of cozy days and soulful tunes.

Heavensent they fall, earthen pull the skies,
Entwined in shiny reveries they make,
The feuding brothers meet.
