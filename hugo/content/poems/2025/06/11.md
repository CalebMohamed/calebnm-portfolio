The unkempt self, a swirl and
Dangerous wisp that plays pretend,
Sits nicely in neat clothes,
Talks nicely in neat words,

Until displeased with its own thought,
Displeased with its poor joke, it churns.
A veil that seethes upon the inward face,
Close breaking storm within the skull,

Less violent though more tense and still,
Like dull aches sparking upon pain,
Long weary sighs which hollowing,
Leave long pauses for an anti-self,

Oh what need I have for Thee!
Firm rock to break upon and mend anew,
To come with rage and leave with grace,
Know comfort and the very hope which spurred my Lord to death,

That I would become His and not my own,
My self would deeply hidden in His life,
Unshaken stand to follow Him to death,
Then through its belly to eternal joy.
