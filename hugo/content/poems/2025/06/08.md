{{< poem >}}
Abstract armies flagged in white,
Contending with dark vestiges,
Advance and posture break into,
A fearless march to someone's death.

Colour fails in this stark game,
Played out in agonising thought:
In every blink ten million years,
In every year ten million blinks.

There is no blood in this foul war,
No mortal men or fiend-stung troops,
No blades or cries beneath fanfare,
But humble stones and empty space.

A hollow world untamed and deathly sparse,
An illquiped will untamed and deathly sparse.
