{{< poem >}}
Great days in thought, long days in thought,
Ever captive to a gripping thought,
In abstract structures and their striking turns,
In maddened grasps at language and its truth,
In fine and painful introspection of the self,
For philosophy and childlike whims,
Now ceased they turn to rest.
By grace they shall not steal the night.
