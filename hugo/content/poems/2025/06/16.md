O birdsong on the morning wind, how I
missed you. You gracious bells, and pleasant chimes,
You stage of love and strife and wittering,
When times were no less simple still, but I 
a simpler man, a boy in homely fields,
You come to me again when without sleep,
I come to you again when strange dreams writhe,
Afresh, I'm human in His light and song.

I'm disheartened when Rachel hardly looks at me in social gatherings. It kind of makes sense seeing as I've been quite distant but I didn't really know what to expect.
