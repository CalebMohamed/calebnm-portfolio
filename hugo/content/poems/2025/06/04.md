The joys of stacking stack on stack,
Filling piles with scrambled thought,
The generous pen upon the page,
Lies flat upon the ceding pale,
The ink encumbered with a heavy toll,
Becomes a faithful squire,
Carries on my swift reply,
Away to estranged questioners,
Displaced through the time by this same means I lean upon.
