Ever in His careful hands we turn,
Where strength meets failing clay,
Slowly every flop He firms,
Restores a charmed asymmetry,
And so redeeming unique saints,
From every walk and tumbled crawl,
All handles, mouths and licks of paint,
He draws out storied gold from dust,
He fashions for Himself an earthly seat,
To pour on out the hope of His great feat.
