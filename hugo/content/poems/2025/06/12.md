{{< poem >}}
When rightly divine love and wit,
Conspire upon fate's turning rings,
To place a call beside the rain,
To hang the clouds and pull the troops,
One after each to face bleak storms,
But whisper of His love and deeds,
So galvanise the soul to prayer,
Which rightly bubbles forth in praise.
