{{< poem >}}
By rolling clouds and ruggard grass,
The early summer heats on breezes pass,
The yellow and the evergreen,
Like deep wind-chimes whistle at this bright scene,
So howling ever as it comes,
An eager herald to Aeolus' runs,
A sturdy bench for such a time,
Seats two's unyielding passage into life,
To gaze upon our youth and trials ahead.
