The clouds stall at the withered scene,
Such aching loneliness in death:
A husk erect in verdant seas,
Still hung but standing on its brittle roots,
Like driftwood scorched amidst a churning swell,
Like hellish flames upon a boat,
Yet surely in its timely fell,
Will many little ones find life.

And so they have.
