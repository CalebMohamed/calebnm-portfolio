The hidden way by dusty trees and gates,
Encumbered seas of wafting leaves it waits,
Gently, the patter of the rain falls dear,
Drawn heavy on the branches rings out clear,
The time becomes so delicate and faint,
A pale sky and a hazy afternoon,
Without much doing it comes calm and quaint.

Church
Lots of lovely goodbyes
Wraps from Opera in jericho with Abi, Bella, and Scooter
Scooter tour and good chat with pool and darts.
Lovely call with brother.
