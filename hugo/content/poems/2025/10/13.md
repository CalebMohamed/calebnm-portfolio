{{< poem >}}
The world is widened in the evening hoots,
The lights burst in their unreality,
Some pillars make fine men out for a smoke,
All flares and wraiths to dance under the veil,
Of closed up skies and such a dimming view,
"Why, we are strangers, aren't we too?"
"I suppose so... in this fine fading place."
