{{< poem >}}
How has it come to be-
I truly am just always walking.
In duet and then at sole,
In ruckus and in steady roll,
Like river and like small eddy,
By louder friends and foes so silently,
Well in truth, when stacked against myself,
The tune is still and whispers shelved,
My gaze is high and low upon the streets,
My sweeping sight is quick upon my feet.
