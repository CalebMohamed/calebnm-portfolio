{{< poem >}}
The wake of open fields lies deep behind,
Wide sparsity swept in tended lilies,
These paths with you lie thickening with words,
For on your garden paths I have found ease,
Not of the brittle kind but ringing true,
Like through the fear all curiosity,
Like through tired eyes all life's abundant joys,
Like this the deepest solace within pain,
Like this the firmest purpose within toil.
