The sum to year for those to hear,
Two tens a-twenty, twenty twenty,
Five upon the millipedes.
Of these long ages spent in strange fashions, 
In gorgeous dreams of sullen clouds linger,
On fields in fleeted seasons myriad,
In 'mail, and robes, and suits and then to falsest weaves of each,
In helms, and hoods, and hats and then to countless scores of each.
