{{< poem >}}
Is this the evening fry on homeward air?
Like far off sounds of sea through fraying wires,
The thin receding wind in open skies,
I long for everhome.
Where all the days are young.

I'd never leave the house of friends,
Or cease to soon become,
I'd have all curiosities,
But truly set on one,
I'd walk with you by wood and stream,
Far to the higher hills...
