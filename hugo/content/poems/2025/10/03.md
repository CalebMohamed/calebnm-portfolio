You tell me of the songs,
The tales and epics of the age,
Far gone, speaking through passing throngs,
The budding romance of the page,

What language must I rhyme?
To hear again the old refrains,
How I long the vantage of a time,
Far gone, it's precepts and it's pains,

A puddle for a mirror,
A dusty way to meekly gain,
A glimpse of sweet humanity,
Far gone in all her ways but one remain.
