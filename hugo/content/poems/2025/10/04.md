{{< poem >}}
Why must things fall apart,
And weariness fall long into a dart?
The pierces and the leaving ache,
The emptiness of hands rising too late,
There is no blood to spill.
No mark of casualty to fill-
These empty hands- yet so I raise,
Them here to You, the one I praise,
The one I rail upon and find so true,
Draw near to me, draw near would You?
