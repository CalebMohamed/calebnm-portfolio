{{< poem >}}
The world in focus stirs the heart,
Each crystal edge fitted with the rays,
It gleans and litters on the street,
They light the tumbling colours of the crowds,
That bob along sandstone canals,
To see the morning light on ancient bricks,
To race the birds to fragrant soil and work the earth.
