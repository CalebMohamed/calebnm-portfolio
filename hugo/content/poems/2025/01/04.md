{{< poem >}}
Like dancing phantoms in a melting pane,
These insights seem to come and fall away,
At once I smelt within the furnace of forgetting,
The world unfolds beneath my lidded eyes,
All steps to where the path lies scattered,
The road leads further on yet turns to glass,
At once I see a face anew: rolling waves in polished jasper.
