# 13.01.25

The chorus of a sold out heart,
In multitudes with adoration,
Joining each to their own part,
In open praise and celebration,

Praise to Him enthroned above,
Praise to Him who swoops below,
Who humbles now Himself to us,
Who takes on every feeble frame,
To hang for us and rise our mighty champion.
13.01.25
