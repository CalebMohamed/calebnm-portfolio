# 06.02.25

In calling out I find my feet,
On precious rock to ground -
All chaos and despair falls weak,
Such mysteries profound,
Tug at my heart to steer my fleet,
To where great wisdom's found,
And at the root the potent brew,
To fear the Lord and turn anew.

Job 28:28 ESV
"And he said to man, 'Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to turn away from evil is understanding.'"
