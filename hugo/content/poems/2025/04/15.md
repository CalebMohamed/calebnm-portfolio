Road trip through roaring wind and rain,
The grumpy lines upon the heights,
Tire out and fold like paper dreams,
Into a psychedelic smile,
Held back to yellow though cascades,
Of colour tug the edge of this,
Strange shift from every deepened grey.

Library trip with Alice and Mary
Worthing library
Lunch on beach
Drive to haywards heath
Tire pressure redone
Haywards heath library
Home

Still working out how I feel about Alice. Frankly confused. Pretty one moment less the next. Still enjoying conversations with her, we made a good team navigating and car stuff.
