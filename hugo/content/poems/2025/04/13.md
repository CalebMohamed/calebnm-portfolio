{{< poem >}}
Because of you I am so rich a man,
The sainthood ever mine a gift to be,
As I am samely sent from Christ to you,
To me your voice and chorus I can't sing,
Your wisdom, smiles and golden hearts I love,
To you my feet, my words, all I don't see,

We walk apart yet to the same true home,
Where all things rightly march else err to death.
The glory of the highest God supreme,
Uniting every fractured good we chased,
First place of Man to which he must return,
Drenched in the blood of God forever free.
