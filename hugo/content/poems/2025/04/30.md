Some kind of clarity at last,
Like shivers from the depth of sleep,
The burning kisses of the sun,
That crawl out of an evening haze,
So weary and refreshed at once,
So warm its breaking into cold,
The path away in sharpened sight,
That takes a toll in drops of blood,
Though I am lighter with the wounds,
I shall remain when they turn swiftly gone.
