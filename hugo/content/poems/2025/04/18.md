Steeped in unordinary tales for now,
The converging of past on past yet still,
The moment of all history that press-
-es down immediate like all the rolls,
Of deepest lakes when moved from deep at root,
All time will never be the same or was,
Without the crowning scar deep at its breast,
From where the Prince Of Glory died.
The very world hangs nailed upon those nails,
The very time a cloth on such a barb.
