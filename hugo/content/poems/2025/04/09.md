{{< poem >}}
False star in intermittent red,
Lays up in friendship with the black,
Closer than the ancient flames,
Distant from a notion of true sight,
The chameleon unveils its eye,
To gaze upon the sleepy hills bellow,
Lazy fits itself upon the canvas of its seat,
A false star veiled in light come red.
