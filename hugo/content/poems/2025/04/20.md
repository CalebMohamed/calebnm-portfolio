The new life born in victory,
What cost and broken tragedy,
Alight with glory burns etern',
The mustard seed of grace but kern',
Which in its sprout puts green to shame,
The flowers stand abashed lame,
Man pulled in his weak mortal seat,
To splendor of immortal feat,
Up to the zoe grande and true,
Our Lord the dazzling firstfruit grew,
The life of God that became light,
To us the hope, the way, our sight!
So glory be and ever be!
To Him the Slain King risen free.
