Adventures north from sleepy fields,
Drew out a smile upon the sun,
The breeze met with a bed of hair to wield,
Beholding all the trees persuading company in shade,

The river writes a fine riddle:
Bottomless but capped with riverbed,
Winding never truly wound instead,
Penniless but bejeweled on every head,

What fine company in shade and sun,
To march upon the gates of sister spires.
