O the weight now gone by grace,
The heights of simple light of life,
From depths of blindness filled with haste,
The horror and the wretched chains,
More metal bitten day by every cramping day.

Hell's poisen struck at its ver' root,
Cut out with all its cloying rust,
Was not the work of man - no badge
Of stoic dispassion nor hedonistic glee,
But truly God in humble robes - the mockers scorn who purchased me.
