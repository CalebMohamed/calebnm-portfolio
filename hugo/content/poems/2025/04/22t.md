{{< poem >}}
What is the meaning of a smile? Is it ever made the same,
Did I bear my heart too fast or hold it back in vain,
My stomach churns and I am felled with hard-placed pain,
Further from me than I ever knew,
Perhaps it was a blindness that I held for you,
To fail to see myself and seemingly you too.
