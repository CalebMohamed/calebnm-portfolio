{{< poem >}}
What joy this message is to us!
A worthy cause for blood to boil,
To wage war against a mundane wilt,
But strive with all His energies for:
The transcendent, good and real,
Love genuine, patience of the daring kind,
For exploits in the field of generous time,
For closessness that makes wise men blush,
For weakness clothed in strength that draws the mocker's scorn.
