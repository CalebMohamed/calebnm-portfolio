Unpassing from this age,
Your glory's truer than a memory,
No second death will touch Your name,
Embedded on the minds of thoughtless shrubbery,

How much more at reason's root,
The canvas of Your moving eyes,
The meekness of Your face born out,
On mocking sneers that spurn the greatest love of every world,

Yet You would be undone to turn such sneers to deepest agony,
The kind to rock the soul and ruin but its truest light,
To spare by mercy those You'd take as friends,
To weep as they are made all right.
