{{< poem >}}
My window to the sun,
Sheer radiance conformed,
To rush through truest edges,
To blaze a cubic beam,
Like unstopped water foaming in,
The shadows a lost vacancy now filled,
I am strangely tugged with warmth,
Not bottled back but ebbing,
With an ever-changing flow that leaves,
My matter buzzing back and forth instead of to lethargic fall.
