# 09.03.25

Beanbags lounging in the lazy sun,
Mundanely cascade into a misplaced cheer,
Too valiant, maddened for this sleepy sky,
Pulling tight the eyes to joyful little creases.

Church
Student + Families lunch
Chilli with the Farleys
Drums with their oldest
Cornhole in the sleepy sun
Then mad rush for laundry
Teddy Hall Evensong
Everything pasta and hanging out
