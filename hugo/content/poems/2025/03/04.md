{{< poem >}}
Halted in their grand procession,
The embers of the day grow stiff,
Subsumed in dreadnought of unbending glass,
Which cradles flames at its own belly's seat,

Even in its flight, the passion of the day
Scorns bright topaz, rubies as if night,

A bright ruler of the dusk lit gold,
Becomes a herald and brief prince,
Faltered into royal red to bleed its fury
On unmoving bowels that face the stars.
