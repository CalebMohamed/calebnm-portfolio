{{< poem >}}
So many nicks,
Accumulate like bites,
The tiny pricks,
That draw a storied line,
The fallen licks,
That marble hands in time,

The velvet and affronted red,
That calls to me about the dead,
About the day that I should go,
So humbly live with this I know:
I never truly see it as it is,
But hardly glimpse upon the fate of all and pray,
Lord would I truly see and humbly live.
