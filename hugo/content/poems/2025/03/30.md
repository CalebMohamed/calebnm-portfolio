Full family hubbub is at water's whim,
Ascending with the tempest twittering birds,
Breaking on the rocks to raving wolves,
At its madness crashing with the croak of toads,
Battered down in silence by slight mice,
To ever nibble at the corner of a thing,
Before the wind picks up and all is there again.
