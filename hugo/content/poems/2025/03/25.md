{{< poem >}}
You hear my earnest plea,
I will ever look to Thee,
For You hear my earnest plea!

You move my heart like nothing else,
All that I am to shudders inexpress:
My grand terror and relief,
My haunting joy and sorrow,
My weakening and might!

O that I may fall so You would rise!
And cascade out the way like silver moon,
For in its rightful place its burns with glory.
