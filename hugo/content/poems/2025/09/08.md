There's much more beauty in each inch,
All stars that hide behind each wistful cloud,
All birds that nest amidst the emerald leaves,
All blades that fill the sight with far more detail that it knows,
The time is too wonderfully slow.
The afternoon just barely drawing breath,
What a time to remake friends.
