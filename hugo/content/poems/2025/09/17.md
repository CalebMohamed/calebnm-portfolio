Beneath the misty front,
All swirls to seize the dying day,
The sound of waves comes dry upon the ears,
It tumbles over self,
And clumsy through the lovely rain,
And layers to its fall like threading rice,
The pitter to the patter making friends,
These little sounds all peak above their ranks,
To find a symphony and glorious song.

I think I still like Rachel but she so frequently misunderstands me and I don't think she likes me back. I think when trying to objectively view our interactions I don't think we have tonnes of chemistry although we have had our moments - it does seem a bit difficult how often she'll snap a comeback or correction and I feel a bit too weary to correct the misunderstanding.
I'm beginning to really like Julia. I remembered how the first time I saw her at getaway I did my usual thing of thinking that she was too pretty to feel confident talking to. I need to be careful not getting too emotionally close before clarifying anything.
