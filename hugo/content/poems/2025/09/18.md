{{< poem >}}
Why, a billow by the breach,
The sternly waves don't pace,
Nor let up but for breath,
Marked out in quite the slight-
-Ly violent crashing just abated,
Then loosely strewn all white decays,
Become the folly of the wind,
The carry-on to their beholden rocks,
Their final seat if not for such a breach,
And tameless tumble in a shocking stream,
Back to the mountain feet from whence they come.
