My face in foamer's disarray,
Breaks on the sand so sparsely speckled,
Dancing polygons ever in collapse,
Like mirrors of a muddy thought,
Like all the breaking waves of unchecked hearts,
Why must it be so straight when I am else,
Why others shall I feel so cloudless clear,
Except on rain days when I am poorly wet.

Analysing the awkwardness around Rachel, I think its exacerbated by the fact that I don't really talk about random stuff with her like I talk with everyone else. I feel like I don't have permission to approach and talk to her. It's connected to my messy feeling towards Alice and Rachel when the crushes were strongest respectively and I really didn't want to 'force it' on them.
