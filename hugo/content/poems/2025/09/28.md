Oh the misty way, begotten of stars,
Like some ephemeral silver, dancing.
The moon is hung somewhere obscure,
The peering stars are few between the clouds,
And the shadows lie still in deep ditches.
The air is so heavy that it's light,
Caught up in all this fuzzy floating,
Falls down to butterfly kisses on the ground,
It seems to hardly greet the grass.
