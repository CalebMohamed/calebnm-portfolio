{{< poem >}}
Another day so spent on tinkering with bliss,
On forming from the edge of sight,
Forms unmeasured rising into light,
Such things inspiring - being inspired,
My very colours call to me to act,
This is some wonky part of art,
This is some muddled way of play,
This is quite something to be deep within.
