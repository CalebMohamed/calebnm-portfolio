{{< poem >}}
A discourse on the sense,
Transcends a thought to straining leap,
Draws out a claw and desperate pace,
To salvage any meaning from the words,
Generalising far beyond this reason,
Straining feebly at the divine present,
Seizing but humility for our efforts.
Thanks Philosophy, it truly did need a song after all.
