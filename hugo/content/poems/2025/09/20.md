Away in hills.
How much I long to find in steps
The pace of unpent thought,
Some kind of room to breath
In every truer sense than flesh,
Darling oak and little stream,
Such quiet beauty stirs the loves,
You are the backdrop of my way,
You are the lodge of weary souls,
For you are whiff and shadow of The Great:
The gentle one who walks in all my ways,
Who knows me and draws out my every song.
