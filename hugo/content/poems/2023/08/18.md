# 18.08.23

Cooped up,
But we've each got more than enough,
Space, between us bed and stuff,
Laid out, suitcases full bursting at the centre,
And we've packed down later.

# Description

Big family BBQ weekend, and we're sharing a very large room with me and my siblings on air mattresses and my parents on a double bed.
