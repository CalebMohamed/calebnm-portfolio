# 08.08.23

Glasses fit the cloudy gaze,
And lines are caught on whetstone firm,
I hear the slicing bladesong clear,
The sound of beautiful creation near,
And now the far I too grasp in my sight,
And thank the Lord my eyes discern.

# Description

Picked up glasses from Specsavers with Mum, I lost mine at college a year and a half ago and its nice to have a new prescription.
