Pool mad,
And the water pitter-patters,
Echoes from the cannon ball with a spatter,
Diving frenzy between my cousins,
Diving before second cousins,
And some siblings are chilling behind,
Switch!
Ball mad,
And a lunge splish-splashes,
Sinking beneath a tapped ball with a passion,
Switch!
Rocket mad,
And we're chucking coloured missiles into the deep,
At each other, and we race to the bottom.
