Laying hands,
And I open up my soul to song,
I praise you as I've known for long:
You've gifted me fellowship in my home,
Faithful friends - brethren of my bone,
And you've made a family line your own,
From broken families new life sown.

# Description

I love my family so much. God has established my parents in doing something new despite the broken situations they came from.
