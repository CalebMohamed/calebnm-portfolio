# 11.08.23

Walking in new worlds,
I see through the eyes of another,
They paint a land in an echo of creation,
In a moment their mind seems to shadow the Almighty,
And He is glorified in the creative act.

# Description

Watched the 2h 20mins film Dune, an adaptation of a sci-fi epic, with the family this evening.
