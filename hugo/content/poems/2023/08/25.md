{{< poem >}}
Frustration and disappointment seem to sublimate at your words,
You clothe the flowers,
And feed the birds,
Why do I restless sit?
My feeble hands so absurd,
Will you not save me from myself?
I believe that you will,
You are Faithful and True,
That is your name still,
All that's good comes from you,
So I'll gather up my heart,
Make it still like the deep,
May it beat when yours starts,
May it break with yours too,
Make me lessen and lessen,
Make me meek as your son,
All my future is yours,
And that future is won,
You provide well for all things,
Yet you value me more,
Every thought let it tinge, 
Until I worry noÂ more.
