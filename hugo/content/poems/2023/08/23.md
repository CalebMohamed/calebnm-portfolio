# 23.08.23

Tinkering around to make defective Pong,
I tap away and then survey,
The errors I begin to solve,
At last it's here,
A Pong half broken,
Along its lines of code at least,
It bears my fingerprints,
So I'm happy with this defective Pong.

# Description

In the process of learning how to make games, I made a version of Pong that isn't quite finished and functions a little strangely but I learned a lot.
