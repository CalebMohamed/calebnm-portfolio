Muddied shoes,  
And mucky adventures clothe the morning,  
I'm walking with some mighty men,  
That is to say those clothed in righteous robes like mine,  
Not of themselves but from our brother,  
And in each passing day they grow like him,  
So talking is great fun with them,  
They like to tell and laugh and listen.
