This blessed bread,  
That feeds the soul,  
And utters glory to the depths of renewed man,  
And such weighty blood,  
That washes dirtied feet,  
And quenches the thirst of walking friends,  
Praise God for this holy remembrance and restorer of these tensile bonds,  
As surely as he sets the sun, shall he knit us closer and wash us clean.
