# 02.04.23
Huddle around dear friends,  
It's time to commit our lives to the Lord,  
To smell, walk and talk like living sacrifices,  
A holy and pleasing aroma to our God - don't you forget,  
And it is He who washes us clean and covers us in his perfume,  
A perfume that was wrung out of him like water from a rag,  
All for love and to his eternal glory,  
Amen.
