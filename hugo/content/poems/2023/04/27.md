# 27.04.23
Days that crawl,  
Along the wheels of time,  
Hamsters on their rocking drums,  
And many things come and go and stall,  
As low stakes clog up the cogs with grime,  
Maybe slower days pass better with a hum,  
And all is right for moments like these,  
To go on by in chugging chunks.

Coming up to study leave for A1 Summer Exams it seemed like all of the pressure left abruptly.
