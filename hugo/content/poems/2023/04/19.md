# 19.04.23
Pale Emperor of the winding wood,  
Your kingdom abounds in brash bristles,  
Taming the rippling mud hills,  
You grasp the light and steal the shadows,  
All falls dim in paling fields,  
And in your calmest annunciation,  
You whisper songs of palest moonlight,  
That measure through the breadth of this land,  
Yet I'll see you soon in withered dust,  
For one domain prevails at last,  
And flimsy flowers grow prideful in their wilting ways.
