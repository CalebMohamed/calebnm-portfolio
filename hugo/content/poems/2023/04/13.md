# 13.04.23
Dream vessel,  
Washed as white as snow,  
I see you again,  
Drifting pale in the sideways starlight,  
Yearning out an incomplete symphony,  
And so left half gone...  
Strapped in part to wandering impossibilities,  
And chained to the tides of deepest unconscious order,  
You stand alone, still, veiled in obscuring violets,  
Felling trees like great hammers that strike the chords of resounding sleep,  
And the walls of truest reality stand firm,  
Begone now,  
Your time is ever yesterday.

# Description
I like playing with the idea of a gargantuan boat trapped in my dreams and using epic imagery to convey its gravity.
