# 14.04.23
The art of play,  
Sits deep in the core of friendly relations,  
And warms the heart,  
And heats the cheeks,  
Lining lips with rows of pearly teeth,  
And a maker stands to watch and nods,  
Good, good, very good,  
Snug as peas in a pod,  
Crafted to be just as they are in moments like these.
