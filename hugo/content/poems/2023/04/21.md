# 21.04.23
Talk the truth,  
And people seem to look away,  
Others gaze into your eyes,  
Others seem to sway between,  
But all in all the land is firm,  
Under your feet and mine and the other's,  
And as we talk we both seem to know:  
Though confusion obscures the truest thoughts,  
We stand on common ground to speak.
