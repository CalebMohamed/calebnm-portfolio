{{< poem >}}
Holy and blameless,  
Wholly good and different,  
Righteous and ever loving,  
Everlasting brother and friend,  
  
You conquered sinful disposition,  
Leaving us bright, pure and righteous again  
In your sight you leave me ever praising,  
Praising your true adoption,  
Freeing us from filthiest dens.
