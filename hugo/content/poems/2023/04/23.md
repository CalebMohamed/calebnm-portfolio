{{< poem >}}
The next generation,  
Tumbles with joy,  
Round about,  
Here and there,  
Into footballs and lessons,  
Into paint pots and pencils,  
Into the arms of their fathers' Lord,  
The faithful one watching over the family,  
And placing them on the shoulders of mighty men of God,  
So tumble with joy into his goodness,  
So tumble with joy into his beautiful precepts,  
They will do you good, little ones.
