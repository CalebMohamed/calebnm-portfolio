# 03.04.23
A little light,  
Flies still in my corner view,  
Just barely peeking out from the cracked darkness,  
It flies Southeast from a creeping split in the door frame,  
And the light floods out from another's room,  
Out into the heart of the quiet attic,  
Where it flies still in my corner view.
