# 09.04.23
Well established,  
Thank you that you cast our roots down deep,  
Watered our soil,  
And sowed us into the arms of mighty brothers and sisters,  
You're so good to us,  
And we're rich in friends,  
Thank you that you have trained our branches in service of this family,  
Praise your holy name,  
Father of my many brothers and sisters,  
Upholder of these gracious days,  
And former of bonds that warm my hearth aflame.
