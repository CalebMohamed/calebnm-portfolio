Mirrors in the muddy grass,  
And your glory permeates the land,  
The light hangs like pearls -  
Drooping off the edges of leaves,  
They seem burdened under the weight,  
Yet hold it with pristine elegance,  
And their brilliance warms the day,  
Even on the ground you place glistening gems,  
Catching wanding sunlight and storing it,  
Resplendent on their gleaming heads,  
The light falls gently now,  
And the shadows seem brighter,  
All the while your beauty triumphs in the dimming days.
