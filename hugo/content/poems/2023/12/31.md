I feel so blessed to be full of time,
At such an early age - surely
This life is but a wink - but His Glory
Fills each moment with a hope and breadth,
For redemptive glory this full time is sufficient,
For redemptive glory I know my redeemer in this passing age,
And I am blessed to see the year roll on.
