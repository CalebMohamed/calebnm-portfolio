# 19.12.23

A day so full I hear it creak like ancient woods,
Crammed full of thoughts and worlds unmapped,
A trail thats littered with my thoughts,
I wander down the path a mile,
Then I pierce through undergrowth!
To scramble on some estranged pebbles,
I walk a mile down twisting turns,
Then I burst through understory!
To knock the dust off memory paths,
To age my mind like whisky in great knowledge casks.
