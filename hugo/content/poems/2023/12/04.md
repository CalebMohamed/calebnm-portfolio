# 04.12.23

A forgotten dreamland,
Caught up in mauve and roman red,
Fermented light adrift the curving ribbons,
They nestle into winding winds,
A depth of cloth fallen into sand,
Like blood coral on the lilac bed,
I sink bellow to deep ebon,
All that's mauve and red is dimmed,
My legs are warmed and filled with lead,
The surface of the deep is soft,
Up, up! I'm met with ribbons in the chiming wind aloft.
