I introduce another meta-poem,
That turns reflective on the very act,
That seems to ever ponder why they come,
Come down to greet me in my mind again,
Come down and sit a ductile metal cold,
And that I steer to something captivating,
But never draw out far to scorn its roots,
I find that as I watch a poem it,
Unfolds to something given and received.
