{{< poem >}}
You've been Eugene'd,
The Christmas has eve'd,
The house has been cleaned,
For merry making,
Great celebrating,
On One whom I lean,
The birth of the king,
Now forever living,
His blood for my sin,
And He humbled Himself as a baby.
\- Eugene DeGooseman

# Description

Bonus:
Last Christmas I gave you a poem,
The very next day I gave you another,
This year to save me from tears,
I'll give you another poem.
