# 24.12.23

You've been Eugene'd,
It's late Christmas eve,
The house has been cleaned,
For merry making,
Great celebrating,
The One whom I lean,
His blood intervened,
On His body my sin,
Now forever living,
And He humbled Himself as a baby.
-Eugene DeGooseman

# Description

Bonus:
Last Christmas I gave you a poem,
The very next day I gave you another,
This year to save me from tears,
I'll give you another poem.
