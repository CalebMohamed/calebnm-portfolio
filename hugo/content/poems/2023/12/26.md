# 26.12.23

The joy of bubbles rediscovered,
At popping and preserving: jubilation,
To look on perfect prisons suspended,
Holding in the melted colours,
Infusing them with curves and boundless roiling,
They seem to melt the light beside,
Entrancing it to bow and blend,
With colours 'till it paints the maelstrom with its brightness,
And halos the edge with specular shine.

# Description

Went to my Grandparents for a meal with them and my cousins. We were given bubbles, because "no one's too old for bubbles" Or something like that. It was really fun trying to blow as big a bubble as possible and then manipulating it in the air with comical swipes and frantic fanning.
