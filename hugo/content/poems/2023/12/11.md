{{< poem >}}
The pressures of the day,
Wash ashore the bed of time,
And all that's left to say:
Is God is good at every line,
All unfolds as one long play,
Yet we hardly see its steady rhyme,
For the glipse I saw, I'll say:
God is good at every line.

**Oxford Interview Reflection**
Hertford 1, 2:50PM
Good times,
Hard times,
Stuck unstuck and stuck,
Writing digitally quick,
Reckoning with questions that elude.
