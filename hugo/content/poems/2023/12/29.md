{{< poem >}}
Still Christmassing,
As I hear the year rolling up just behind,
Rampant on the edge of time to swallow past,
Hasty to unfurl the New Year yet it slows,
To see a hectic reunion span the west,
To watch the twinkling lights before they cease,
To glimpse the winking moonlight on the people as they chatter.
