# 09.12.23

To fight the cold in these solid days,
My sword a reproducing shiver,
My breastplate woven fabric interlapping,
Yet in these solid days,
That press against the edge of space,
I feel ten suns there to my side,
A warmth through-seeping layers deep,
Now I am soft melting.
Bound up in fabric interlapping.
