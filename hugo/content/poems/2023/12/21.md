I see a dreamscape out far out of blue,
The sky is like the turning underwave,
It's light like bowing bubbles pressed close up,
A kind of flowing network made in threes,
They bundle up and wobble in the wind,

I am adrift in vacant currents swarming,
They swarm until I'm full of stillness true,
I'm greeted by no floor but silence by,
The underwave accomplished in the breeze,
I wonder why it dwells just out of reach,

I see the light turn gently in the rays, 
Out deeply into skies above I gaze.
