# 08.12.23

Travel is as travel does,
Sipping on the cooling air I walk,
In shadows cast and through the pale,
And evening glow that takes a perch upon my toes,
Then to the belly of a metal snake,
A gentle rumble then I feel a tug,
It blankets me and presses in but I press more,
I walk along to find its teeth,
And wait for when it opens wide,
I am in a place that's not the same,
I am in a place that's far from home.
