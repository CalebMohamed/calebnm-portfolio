The pale walls slow down and halt to gray,
In dimming lights they shed their hue,
And let it pool in churning shadows on the floor,
Some hold tight to wilting red,
They fall head long to deeper black,
And weave into the fabric pale,
Hung up to drip their colours down,
Down, down, entrenched in folds of night,
That swell but don't recede in falling eve,
And all is coloured grey and coal,
But shadows don't dare cast such fear,
For they roll now to whims of light.
