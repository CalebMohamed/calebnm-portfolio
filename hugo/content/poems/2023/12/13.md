{{< poem >}}
I'll see you in the garden,
My rock and hiding place,
My rushing stream to guide the way,
I'll see you in the quiet glade,
I'll see you by the mottled crags,
My song and glory crying out,
My light and spotless righteousness,
I'll see you on the holy mount,
And walk with you to streets of golden glass,
And know no light apart from you.
