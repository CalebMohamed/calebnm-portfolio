Darkest shadow drenches the land in its silky robes,  
And the sound of death fills the air,  
Empty echoes haunt the name of sound itself.  
  
Stale air crusts over the fresh embers of day,  
And the violence reaps its weighty silence,
The shifting tides of dust seem to shudder imperceptibly,  
But still the deep night doesn't shroud the thirst for life.
