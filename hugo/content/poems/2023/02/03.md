# 03.02.23
Clak, clink, kungf,  
And the chains are sprawled down,  
Down on the ground,  
Shattered and defeated,  
Heavy and repeated,  
-ly they're broken daily,  
All for a wonderful streak,  
BC to AD a billion million combo,  
That's neat.  
How amazing,  
Is this chain shaking saviour,  
Blood stained maker,  
Beautiful creator,  
And he will continue tomorrow.
