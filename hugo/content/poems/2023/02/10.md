# 10.02.23
Fellowship with guys far older than I,  
A celebration of two fathers,  
Filled with laughter,  
Warm food on the table after,  
Old tunes blast loudly overhead,  
But the conversation hits the mind-master,  
The master's mind that is,  
The master's mind that guides boys and men to his side,  
He's the great one,  
And conversation settles on his ways and wisdom.
