# 05.02.23
Surge "  
The rate of change of acceleration  
"  
  
I feel a great surge,  
It compels me forward,  
It tickles my toes until I jump up,  
It guides my hands to act,  
  
To bless and petition,  
To hope and intercede.  
  
Whistling winds catch my ears in their melody as I move quicker,  
And then at a quicker rate,  
And then in a blink I'm moving faster than ever before.  
  
Yet it is not my own power in these wings  
Yet it is not my own breath in these lungs,  
Yet I am not my own...  
No worries, He's a better pilot than I.
