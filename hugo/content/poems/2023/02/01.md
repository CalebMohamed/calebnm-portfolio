{{< poem >}}
Slow days,  
Seemed filled with much more time than others,  
Yet I taste the imperfection of the hours,  
Creeping by and blasting spotlights on my hidden pride,  
Showing me the limits of my mind.  
May I decrease Lord,  
Still my spinning thoughts and realign my expectations,  
May you increase,  
Keep my eyes on you as I tread the waves,  
And walk along allotted paths,  
My eyes on you.
