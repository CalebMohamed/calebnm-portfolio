{{< poem >}}
Reasonable God,  
You love to think and make,  
You love to think of all creation and of dust to which you gave,  
A mind to think, and a heart to love,  
Love your ways and ponder your wisdom,  
Consider your goodness and the work of your hands,  
Consider your nature and the beautiful land,  
Praise be to God the greatest thinker and king,  
Praise be to God who's jealous and righteous for our thoughts.
