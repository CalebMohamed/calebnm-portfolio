# 06.02.23
Late eve talking with some friends of mine,  
Sitting in a call as the minutes pass on by,  
A warm lamp shining on my desk,  
Yet the light is cold on my skin tonight,  
You Lord can do something new,  
Guide my words,  
Toss some light through their windows at night,  
And place your shadow in their sight,  
Lord you can do it in your mighty providence,  
Give them hints of your mighty presence,  
And warm their lost hearts,  
Amen.
