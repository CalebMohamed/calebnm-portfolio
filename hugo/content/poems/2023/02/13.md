# 13.02.23
A malevolent storm rouses the sand from its slumber,  
And vain monuments rise from the scorched dust,  
All the while these embers of the wind utter course and rocky violence.  
  
Lashing sands blindly whip themselves into a rage,  
Parched bones in a pile of yearning reflections,  
They are ground down in their fury,  
They seek the water too.
