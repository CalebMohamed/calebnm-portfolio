# 26.02.23
Walking shadows,  
Walk between the longing shade,  
And talk between the leaning trees,  
On mud, gravel and stone beneath their darkened feet,  
Overlapping sometimes,  
Doubled up and down to split beyond,  
They silent walk and talk in pocketed hands,  
And gaze sideways at numerous stars.
