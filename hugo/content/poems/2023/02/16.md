# 16.02.23
Merry faces,  
Line these stairs and call out from beneath the dust of time,  
They remind us of his faithfulness and the unity he's sown,  
Of the places he's taken us,  
Of the people he's made us,  
Thank you Lord for standing with this house and making it yours,  
Help us to follow you daily and love one another as you have loved us,  
Amen.
