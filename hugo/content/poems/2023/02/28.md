{{< poem >}}
Close your eyes,  
And think of deepest night,  
Seeping through the lidded gaze,  
Dark and deathly,  
Harrowing and still,  
Repulsive even to the twisted mind,  
Deeper than the deepest fright,  
Such darkness is there chained forever,  
Never breaching the light of life,  
Never marring lovely times,  
He won't allow such reckless spite,  
Not in its fullness,  
Not in its blights,  
For grace abounds in groaning days,  
For mercy falls as monsoons rage,  
And all is washed in patient gaze,  
He will not watch in passive might,  
He gives a chance to broken kites,  
To fly again.
