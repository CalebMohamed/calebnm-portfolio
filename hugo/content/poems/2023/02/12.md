{{< poem >}}
A lake of crystals slumps into the earth before me,  
Serpentine ripples dance along the watery film and glide over the heaps of sand,  
It washes the ground in dilute blues.  
  
A tired thirst doubts the sight,  
Sounding out a quiet flutter of wings that ascends into a pulsing murmuration,  
A quick wave of the hands and the water turns to vapour,  
And the mirage recedes.
