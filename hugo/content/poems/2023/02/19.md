# 19.02.23
The waahwaah tree,  
Stands dignified in the jungle of its melody,  
Pastel fragments of light step between existence and non-existence,  
Playing like fairies on the singing winds,  
And adding flashes of flavour to the flowing melody,  
All is like a dream,  
The shadows too bright and the lines blurred and fuzzy,  
Wrapping up the marshmallow clouds in softer blankets of fluffy uncertainties,  
The land seems to fall through and stand firm,  
As the whirring waahwaah contextualises the floating footing.
