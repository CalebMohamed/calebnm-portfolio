# 08.02.23
A small cat with bright eyes,  
Stands frozen to stone before a curious gaze,  
On its face - clearly guilty,  
On the nose - quite clearly ashamed,  
The cavity runs deeper in the treat box,  
The tumbling treats more cavernous than innocent days,  
It's seems a rough tongue is twisted into bows and knots,  
And meowing shall delay for the moment,  
Treats will surely come anyway?
