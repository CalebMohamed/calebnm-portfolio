{{< poem >}}
School is back on the horizon,  
And I offer up my toil to you,  
I will delight in you and you in me,  
And you promise to renew me,  
And you promise to make me holy,  
So as I look over the horizon of weighty sleep,  
Keep my eyes on you,  
And my will on its knees,  
Reverent and loving,  
For I see you there amidst the bleak greys and overt pastels,  
I see you there - waiting for me.
