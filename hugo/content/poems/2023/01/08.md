Dark nights and bright days,  
Coalesce in a brilliant cycle,  
And He steps in.  
  
Shadows are as light to him,  
Even in the depths, He won't let me dwell alone,  
On the highest heights He sits and points me further up.  
  
At the core of my soul He tabernacles,  
And so I call abba Father,  
Through dark nights and bright days.  
  
Life chained in death,  
Shall not be held long,  
For He knows chains like no other.  
  
The chains of Sheol held him there,  
And He bore on himself the cold metal of the unrighteous,  
And became sin to break mine.
