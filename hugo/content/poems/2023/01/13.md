{{< poem >}}
Oxygen debt is a peculiar thing,  
A big small grace from God,  
That's hard to place as significant or insignificant...  
  
That is until you run,  
For when you run he allows you to do a borrowing of his breath,  
And trade the very life in our lifeblood for transient lactic acid,  
Oh how it burns the breath and stings the chest,  
Yet it will pass away so soon.  
  
In the selfsame way:  
He gives us life for transient suffering,  
Ever passing, and forever unequal to the grace,  
So that we can run the blessed race,  
And reach him there where he sits with life and treasure forevermore.
