{{< poem >}}
Meet me there in deepest thoughts,  
And grow me into deepest silence,  
Your words so great, and deepest wisdom,  
Do abound in deepest nights.  
  
Grow in me a zealous hunger,  
For your word and weighty things,  
To sit beside the deepest thinkers,  
Resting on your faithful shoulders.
