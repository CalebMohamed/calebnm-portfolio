{{< poem >}}
A heavy cold is about,  
The very manifestation of violent stillness,  
Uncaring of the ember it devours like a lamb,  
Impassive to the dancing lights that fall dull in its maw.  
  
Just as the old king said,  
A time for all things under the Sun,  
For the pleasant rays,  
And voracious blight.  
  
A corroding of pipes and stripping of bricks,  
Cracking mud when the chilly night pursues,  
The cold days are few,  
Yet now they begin again.
