Balance,  
It's all about the balance they whisper,  
Spewing velvet lies like heaps of broiling mustard gas,  
We weigh with faulty scales, don't you see?!  
  
But they don't see,  
Loving what destroys in the darkness,  
Loving fools' gold in the place of life,  
Loving life in place of eternity.
  
Nerves die with the rest, don't you see?!  
Pleasure is so quickly dim,
And reality is awaiting like a lion,
For you to climb into its jaw in your stupor.
  
You'll only find it when you lay down your scales for His,  
One day your scales will be rebuilt,  
But now they are as though rubbish to you,  
I urge you, throw them out.
