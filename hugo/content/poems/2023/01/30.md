A deep dive into the ocean of my thoughts,  
Rolling waves neatly hedge in the deep with a compassionate hug,  
A salty impression tickles the nose and calms the heart,  
Under the surface coral blues violently mesh and fold into one with deep indigo,  
Sublime scaffolding pokes out from the midnight blue, obscured,  
Holding together and structuring the origami currents from the depths,  
Contextualising and refining little swirls into whirlpools,  
Deeper still a cry is heard,  
Abba Father...  
Down beneath the darkest shades of thought.
