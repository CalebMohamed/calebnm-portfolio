When does the young become old?  
When white and grey crowns its brow?  
When creeping cracks weather a sign into absurdity?
When novelty becomes mundane as a rock?  
When sufficient time has passed?  
How much?  
  
Such a thing alludes the mind,  
A blurred line on the page,  
With no pen in sight,  
Its incorporeal to the vexation of the impatient,  
I guess I wouldn't know...  
I'm not that old anyway.
