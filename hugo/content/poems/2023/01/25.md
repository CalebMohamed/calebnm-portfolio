{{< poem >}}
Sleepy eyes...  
Follow the brilliant white keys along the screen,  
Hiding depths of groggy wakefulness,  
'Maybe poems will come'  
The eyes whisper to the screen,  
An inaudible sizzle meets the gaze,  
They sit in ponderance,  
For the night is younger than it could be,  
And tomorrow shall remain a little ahead of them,  
As it always has...
