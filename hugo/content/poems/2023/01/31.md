{{< poem >}}
Light a fire,
And see the embers stoked to flame,  
Orange tongues - a multitude of crackling sayings,  
Hope and warmth for another night,  
To turn the cold away,  
In the morn' I'll clear the ashes,  
And see you there as clear as day,  
Thank you for Hope,  
And days of yearning witness in the fray,  
Of life and turning hands,  
As minutes pass and hours slow.
