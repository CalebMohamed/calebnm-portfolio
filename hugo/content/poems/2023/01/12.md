{{< poem >}}
Hey Lord,  
It seems some burdens have been dripping between my fingers,  
Squirming through like the good ol' 'H's with that big round 'O'.  
  
I'm sorry Lord for letting them fall into my lap,  
They don't belong here,  
And you promised to take them from me,  
I'm all wet now but it can't wash off the scent of your blood.  
  
I lay upon you my future,  
My ambition or lack there of,  
My desires,  
My fickle sense of justice,  
And my grievances.
