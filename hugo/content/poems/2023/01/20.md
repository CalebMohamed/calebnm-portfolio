{{< poem >}}
Silence has a lovely tone,  
And depths in which few dare to tread,  
The hubbub has its murmuring merits,  
But silence and the little sounds...  
  
Silence and the little sounds hold such weight,  
In noisy days that seem to mound,  
Mound and mound like weary walls,  
And tower in their furious fever.  
  
I wish to sit in silent times,  
Dare I tread in those black waters?  
Yes I dare in silent sound,  
And tomorrow a little longer will I try.  
  
Try to be less busy with it all,  
And leave my work in churning fields,  
All when the day is done.
