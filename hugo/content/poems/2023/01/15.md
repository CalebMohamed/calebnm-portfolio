{{< poem >}}
Jesus, I wish to ask you why you are so beautiful,  
Yet such a question in its simplest form,  
Is answered by a hefty pondering,  
Are not all beautiful things so, because they seem a smidge like you?  
  
Just a smidge like you:  
And flowers take the breath away,  
And smiles melt the heart,  
And sunsets turn the hazy day to arresting clarity.  
  
You are beautiful as brute fact,  
Wholly good and just,  
Wholly caring and amusing,  
Wholly love and truth.  
  
Wholly beautiful.
