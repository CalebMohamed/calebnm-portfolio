Praise be to God the highest,  
Great Creator,  
Maker of this space and time,  
Mover of the tiny mountains,  
Which stoke the deepest feels sublime,  
Dancer and great choreographer,  
Weaving walks with crawls and rhymes,  
Speaker of great truth and matters,  
So greatly that His Word's alive,  
Wonder, wonder, filled with laughter,  
Sit alone in times of quiet,  
Gaze upon the author's work,  
Take the time to praise and chime:  
  
Wonder, wonder, filled with laughter,  
Praise the one who came and died,  
Wonder, wonder, filled with laughter,  
Fill the earth with weighty cries,  
Wonder, wonder, filled with laughter,  
Praise the one who lives and shines.
