{{< poem >}}
Awash in the flow,  
He's calmed my voice down low,  
The spirit decending in a perfectly measured overflow,  
Great buckets of uncountable blessings in an ordered row,  
All wisdom does he know,  
And wish to share with us?  
  
He's about,  
He's sowing in His priests,  
Sowing and blowing to the feast,  
Sowing and blowing yeast into the bread,  
And raising people from the dead,  
Speaking the unsaid with truth and love.  
  
Its all for the great show,  
All the people and the world will know,  
That He's coming with life and death in tow,  
The clouds His sandals,  
The heavens His cloak,  
And it will be glorious.
