{{< poem >}}
On the road,  
We’re heading to that singing city again,  
Looking to honour his name,  
To be a people that love to praise,  
For me and my house we will follow the Lord.  
  
He’s been gracious to us,  
Patient with us,  
A blessing to us,  
A saviour for us,  
And He’s not done loving on us.  
  
It’s a new year for Him to say:  
That He still has plans for me,  
That He’s here to stay,  
And it’s so good to be by His side.
