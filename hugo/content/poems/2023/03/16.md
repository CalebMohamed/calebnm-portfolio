# 16.03.23
Chaining stars,
Seem to string together in succession,
Forming a deep formation spanning the firmament,
They line the recesses of the local cosmic clusters like valiant halls,
And burn in concentrated power,
King's over domains bestowed,
Beyond them the invisible one presides,
Appreciating the beauty of his work still,
Let us join Him.
