{{< poem >}}
Counting the cost like loose change,  
The coins seem to fall from my fingers and roll into the weeds,  
Muddied and obscured,  
Friends found and lost in part,  
Help me to continue to show them love,  
For you are sovereign, Lord,  
I lift up such things to you,  
You are worth it, Lord.
