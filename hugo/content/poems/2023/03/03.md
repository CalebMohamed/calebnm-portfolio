I see you there,  
The floating bastion,  
Austere in raging, fragile might,  
Ever passing like the countless vessels of deepest sleep,  
So drift alone - elusive on the non-Euclidian waves,  
Dance alone - trancelike by the shores of burning ice,  
Dread alone - steadfast under the weight of sharp realities that eat...  
Dream vessel of impending past,  
Be drenched in purple blues and clearest cyan,  
Translucent like the crystal's shards,  
Begone now,  
And recede into the lifting dream.
