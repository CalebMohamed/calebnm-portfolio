Bouncing off the walls,
Ecstatic but you're caught lacking,
And you're slapped back a bit,
Bouncing down to the front of the back,
And it's time to wait your turn again,
Tick tock and the clacking hands click into place,
Waiting's over and the ball is clattering,
Tapping and packing punches to the floor and you whack it,
And you roar again at the wildest plays,
It seems we're bouncing off the walls today.
