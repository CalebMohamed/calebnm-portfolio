The ray of light is sheered in two,
And scatters like a sparkler's bolts,
Over the edge of the gleaming orb,
That seems to warp slightly in softest slow,
And reveal a wild rotation underneath,
A shiny coin that turns head down,
Before tails flips from whence it left,
And back and forth they tumble,
Static in the air,
Yet chained to the palm beneath,
And with a tug of nature's grasp,
The gleaming coin falls down in spinning haste,
And falls face up to glare at the ceiling,
It's tail behind and hidden now,
On palms beneath.
