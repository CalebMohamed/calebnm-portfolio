# 23.03.23
Shaded walls,
Do flow on upwards,
Sheering off to a flat face above,
A surface that is,
Nothing strange to see,
But nighttime waltzing to the tune of retreating day,
When noonday folk do rest from their toil,
And gaze upon their feeble framings that must recharge beyond tight shut eyes,
And thoughts fall into the weary dust of dreaming-scapes.
