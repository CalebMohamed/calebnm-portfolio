{{< poem >}}
Shaded walls,
Do flow on upwards,
Sheering off to a flat face above,
A surface that is,
Nothing strange to see,
But nighttime waltzing to the tune of retreating day,
When noonday folk do rest from toil,
And gaze upon their frames beyond tight eyes,
And thoughts fall into weary dust of dreaming-scapes.
