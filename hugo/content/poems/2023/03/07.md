Talking heads,  
Utter crisp syllables,  
In quest of articulated clarity,  
A common desire for understanding,  
And they walk the streets paved by similar wanderers from ages past,  
Who too wished for understanding and knowledge,  
Who too wished for truth and clarity,  
O Great towering walls and deepest libraries,  
Do you contain such lofty things?
