# 04.03.23
Words to pass the time:  
Like [pass]ing salt and pepper grinders between,  
[Grind]ing out the minutes and seconds,  
[Second] to the moving clock,  
[Mov]i[e]s rolling into hours,  
[H]on[our]ing times and precious moments,  
[Prec]ar[ious]ly stacking loose thoughts,  
[Loos]ing clothes to slip on pajamas,  
[Cloth]ing slippers in the sands of time,  
[Sand]y, dusty and all cobwebbed up,  
Like [cob]bled stone, long still and final,  
[Final]ly the time is passed,  
And words remain a sufficient slot,  
To fill the time.
