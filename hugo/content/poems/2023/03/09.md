Two behemoths side-eye each other,  
Charging to the tune of diverging cast-iron fates,  
Yet centimeters from carnage,  
The wind seems to buckle and grind out growls and resounding pops in between the mad dash,  
And then all is still again,  
Only a low whine betrays the ongoing bolt to the next stop...  
Maybe to another zealous confrontation also.
