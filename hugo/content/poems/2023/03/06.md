{{< poem >}}
Blood poisoned,  
And a chained brain,  
And mind predicted: broken,  
Little hope for a little boy,  
Who's blood didn't quite match up...  
For a happy dispatch to the land of the breathing,  
Then the mind-mender stepped in,  
And He's been mending my mind every since,  
Till I'm like His son,  
So I continue to think,  
And glorify this mind-mender of mine,  
With thoughts maths and rhymes.
