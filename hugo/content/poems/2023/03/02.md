# 02.03.23
Promptly plating packed peanuts,  
For pill-and-drill-proof protection,  
So that the peanut payload can be perused by the proper person,  
Pulled out and perceived in all its popping pazaz.  
  
Powerful procedures pre-empt such perilous pulling,  
For proud peanuts pluck and posses the pitiable person with unparalleled palatable pleasantries,  
Maybe ever more pleasurable than patisseries,  
How peculiar.
