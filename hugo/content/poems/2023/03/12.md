# 12.03.23
A clacking tactile snap resounds,  
And wooden bricks are stacked on high,  
And laughter guides these leaning towers.  
  
A little tap wacks at the loose-looking blocks,  
All to find a delightful tug,  
That leaves the tower toppling not.  
  
Praise God for joyous, blood-tied delight,  
With placed people to share a good game,  
And to hear of hard days and light stories too.
