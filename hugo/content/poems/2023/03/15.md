# 15.03.23
On the clock,
My hand's not motionless by the side,
It wiggles and squiggles,
A firm pen in its stride,
And a stream of logic pours out from my mind,
Hopefully correct most times out of five.

And off it goes,
Reasoning with symbols,
Considering the knowledge bestowed,
Be glorified by such things in your heavenly abode.

For context I now am doing three, two hour maths papers a week for my homework.
