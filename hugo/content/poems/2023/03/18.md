Leveled ground,
He makes the very land sturdy and straight,
Drenching and molding it with grace,
We can trust the rock that He placed,
The rejected cornerstone,
That smooths out and shatters walls,
That we can stomp on and feel His integrity,
That we can fall on and know He won't go away,
That we can kneel on and know His security and faithfulness,
His grace paves the narrow way and calls us to cast down our shackles of sin,
For they cling to our wrists in bits and we must cast them down with determined shakes.
