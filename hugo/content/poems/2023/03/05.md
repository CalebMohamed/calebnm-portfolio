Rend to Him what doesn't shine,  
But beats and hums and gasps in awe,  
Send to him for living wine,  
In exchange for breathing gifts,  
Gifts He bought with more than time,  
More than pity and more than advice,  
But pulsing flesh for flesh, and many signs,  
Goodness flows from such a Lord,  
And slavery yields eternal life,  
For righteous ways make glad the heart,  
And humming things shall gasp with joy,  
Free at last to truly live,  
Free at last to know the truth,  
Know him like the friend He is,  
Know him as the great I AM.
