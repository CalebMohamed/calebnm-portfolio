{{< poem >}}
Reflective orbs cascade down like a myriad of miniature marbles,
They hit the pan and comingle with the oil,
The world seems to stutter for a moment,
And suddenly, a serpentine hiss rises from the metal,
Dull fireworks spray out at the reptilian call,
And the oil seems to growl over the surface of the pan,
Seems hot enough.
