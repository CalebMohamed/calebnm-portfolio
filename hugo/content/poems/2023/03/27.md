{{< poem >}}
Open spaces,
Make me small and surround me,
Place me in my right place to see...
The world and all its wonders grand,
That unfold out to drench man in the sublime,
And much clicks into wondrous place,
When largest scales do make you see,
Your world and Lord in truer might to mightless men.
