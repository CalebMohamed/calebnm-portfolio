# 02.07.23
Broken body,
Outpoured blood,
Sustenance for a feeble soul,
Salvation for a hungry people,
Great rising joy for all the world,
Praise you for you did not spare,
A hand or leg but gave it all,
Your body crushed,
My soul redeemed.

Had communion with my parents and some guests and it was lovely.
