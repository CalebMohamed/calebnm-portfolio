{{< poem >}}
Come crashing down dear hope of mine,
Not wishful in the slightest sense,
But gifted by the Faithful One,
Of things unfinished,
Things not seen,
Things to dance about and praise,

Goodness past assures the soul,
And goodness now for my rejoicing,
Yet goodness near is shelter from despair,
Umbrella to the stormy day,
Shield to raging flames and darts,
Life to dying oaks and brush,

Come crashing down dear hope of mine,
Not wishful in the slightest sense,
But gifted by the Faithful One,
Of things unfinished,
Things not seen,
Things to dance about and praise.
