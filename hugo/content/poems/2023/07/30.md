O marching time,
Ever advancing to the quartz command,
And out you roll in legions of meadows,
There's beauty in your fractured smile,
Great virtue to your steadfast soil,
And order to your reed-whispered seconds,

I saw a glimpse in temporal plains,
Behind you lies a greater mind,
And we too reside in drempt up fields.

Shattered dreamer,
I behold you, my pride conceived,
A dream of something unchained: unruly,
A striving after fragile might,
And I see you broken on far truer shores,
No spectacle here in drempt up fields.

I'm humbled now,
Assured by this here gracious dream,
Recede now, shattered vessel.
