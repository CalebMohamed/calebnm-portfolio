Bold-faced buildings,
Austere in lines ubiquitous,
Bounded by the patchwork clouds,
You guide the pavements through their paths ordained,
Outposts for the greener courtyards strewn behind,
How compelling is your brick-laid outlook,
You care for function, purpose, design,
And do not care for flaunting dress,
Your hearths glow warmed instead,
Endowed with ornaments of purpose,
Placed by your builder so.
