Impulses in the descending black,
Like rifts of passion that tear through bleak shadows,
They hide in metal covers on the road,
The sit on lofty thrones above,
Their subjects dance on metal stools,
They sit like second eyes infront,
Bursting from our tin charger,
That likewise plunges into the night.
