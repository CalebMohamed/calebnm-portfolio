Seconds waving by my shins I stand,
Surrounded by some clockwork legions,
Ordered beauty emergent in the uniform reeds,
And the passing time seems ever more masterfully constructed and composed,
If only chaos did not overun my shadows...
Shattered dreamer,
We do not dance in common fields,
You stand unsettled bursting through the seams of time,
You strike at chords too ancient for a tale,
The likes of which my dearest dreams hold not a candle,
Be humble,
Behemoth of the timeless sea,
Be still,
Your finitudes lie veiled beneath your gaze,
Begone,
You know not that which you lust to shatter.
