{{< poem >}}
Running round in sophisticated circles,
Not like mere cat and doggery,
We have spinning arms and chains,
With bars to hold,
And bars to fly on,
Stepping a pace and a half and off,
The pivoting arm rises up diagonal,
And we fly for paces many,
Grounded before we grow new wings,
And run around in sophisticated circles.
