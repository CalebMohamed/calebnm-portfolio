# 29.07.23

Running round in sophisticated circles,
Not like mere cat and doggery,
We have spinning arms and chains,
With bars to hold,
And bars to fly on,
Stepping a pace and a half and off,
The pivoting arm rises up diagonal,
And we fly for paces many,
Grounded before we grow new wings,
And run around in sophisticated circles.

# Description

My family went to my Aunt and Uncle's to celebrate her birthday. They have a park nearby containing this strange pivoting structure with some handle bars.
