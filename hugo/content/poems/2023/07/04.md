# 04.07.23
Fall asleep on carpet bristles,
Encircled by a talking family,
Heavy brain inside your skull,
Rests warm beneath a dream-woven duvet,
And cozy warmth spreads through and through,
On carpet bristles halfway soft.

# Description
Tired on the front room floor. The carpet's getting on in years so a little ruggedy and not so soft, but not quite unpleasant either.
