Roasting in the sun with Dad,
Along the heaped up concrete so,
Atop the sprawling brickwork so,
Aside the neat cube hedges tall,
Our legs don't haste like prior days,
But walk half fast,
But walk half slow,
And meet in middle heel to toe,
And roast in Summer rays,
For lunchtime walks do friendships grow.
