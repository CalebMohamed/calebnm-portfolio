{{< poem >}}
Clicking snaps layer like paper,
Flush against the squirming sound beneath,
They nudge the grass in swaying resonance,
Dancing to the grass-hopping tune,
These little critters play the wind,
With sprung legs and rocket boots,
Their muscles like pistols coughing steam from clicking joints.
