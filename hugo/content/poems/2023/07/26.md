Fold the files within themselves,
Line them up on digi-shelves,
Write things out on digi-notes,
Draw a box to tick in time,
Organise the space to rhyme,
Try to track the talking tasks,
They whisper deep in warmer days,
I wish to catch them,
And form a digi-house to store them,
Brick by brick for my own workflow.
