What a gift it is to see,
To watch the world,
To look with glee,
This beauty bursting before me,
Imposing truth on mind unfurled,
A looking glass to hands unseen,
Assuring me of my Lord's long plea,
To know him and his handiwork,
To see that He's forever good,
To humble eyes and gaze anew,
To look long on Him and not avert.
