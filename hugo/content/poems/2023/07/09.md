# 09.07.23
Smelting thoughts,
Like ores the impurities boil away,
Condenses down into interesting nuggests,
Strung together in chains,
I season them with colour,
And watch them dance.

# Description
Using a note taking software called Obsidian which allows you to hyperlink your notes together like a personal wiki. I have a process where I take 'raw' notes which are more fleeting and just trying to capture ideas from what I'm reading and then processing them and editing them down into 'smelted' notes which are briefer, reference the source and link to other processed modular thoughts. I've moved all my poems here too.
