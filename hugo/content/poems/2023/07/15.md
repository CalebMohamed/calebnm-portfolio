# 15.07.23

Bustled room,
That is to say that the bustling is complete,
Crazy smells wafting up from the meat,
There's some chillie and beans,
And the spices are elite,
Fueling the talk of a family of five,
Full bellies later and we're back on the drive.

# Description

Went to a restaurant with my family to talk and (very belatedly) celebrate my sister's birthday
