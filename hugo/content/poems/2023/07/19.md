# 19.07.23

Sore hands,
Caked in chalk,
They sizzle like a good steak,
Flamed and barbecue fired,
I connect them - to the heat placate,
And they seem to spark through the cracks between.

# Description

Went bouldering (no rope climbing) at Boulder Brighton today and it was a fun and challenging time.
