{{< poem >}}
In the waking twilight,  
The sky looms still,  
Amused in dying passions of colour,  
A school of stars swim frozen in the timeless seconds,  
Stalled out of sight behind the withering elation of evening,  
Perplexed, the outside world is grasped in overbearing memory,  
Locked out by windows then eyelids before it is encased in my head,  
I bend it slightly to convey a folded beauty,  
And I spill it out onto this virtual page,  
Light as paper,  
Pen flowing as binary charge.
