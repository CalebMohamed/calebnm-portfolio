# 21.05.23
I'm jelly down to my marrow,  
All tired out from proclaiming,  
Praising the father for the banished sorrow,  
For he came and he conquered all that there ever was,  
Now when death comes, sin doesn't sting tomorrow,  
Free at last by the bread and blood,  
And I just want to serve him more than I ever was.
