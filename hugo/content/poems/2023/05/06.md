# 06.05.23
Shining band,  
Severs the carpet twain,  
Castings glossy shadows to its sides,  
Folding reflections with its dullest shades,  
A demarcation for the flowing rooms,  
To inscribe the flowing floors with resolute boundaries,  
And split the carpet twain in glimmering style.

Just the silver edging in the doorway to Mum and Dad's room from the landing.
