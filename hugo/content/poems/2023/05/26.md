# 26.05.23
Roped in and held with care,  
Sharing laughs with your Church in service,  
We're here for you,  
You are truly our everything,  
And we seek to place you more in our sights,  
Till earthly things fall dull by the wayside,  
And we hear you clearly.

# Description
Weekender begins and I'm 'roped in', helping with welcoming and directing the campers and housers as they arrive
