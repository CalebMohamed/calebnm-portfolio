# 15.05.23
Sitting in the sunny grass,  
And the urban sprawl lies sandwiched in my sight between,  
The rolling hedges and the ocean line,  
It frays the sky - its roots upended,  
And holds its peace below the clouds,  
Sharper than a razor's edge,  
And laying here the grass imprinted,  
My gaze procured in sunny fields.
