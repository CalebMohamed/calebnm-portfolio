# 04.05.23
Clipping nails,  
And they ping like rubber into the bin...  
Mostly.  
  
Trimming my finger shields,  
To help in dextrous finger flipping,  
Furious finger picking, flicking, pinching and prodding.  
  
They're rounded with a rugged, artsy edge,  
Mostly rounded I must say,  
To place myself in linguistic safety.  
  
Finally fit for the cause, that I pledge,  
Ready for more finger adventures tomorrow...  
Poem tapping included: batteries not so much.
