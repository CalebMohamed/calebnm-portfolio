Trying talks,  
And the time trickles by,  
And I try to understand the tones,  
But the tri-tones just seem to trace the boiling emotion,  
And I'm shifting through a timeless stew,  
That tastes so tangible and not,  
And I sit confused,  
But an answer sits at the tip of my tongue,  
Yet He left it there for another day,  
When I'll be a little better prepared for trying talks,  
It never left his hands anyway.
