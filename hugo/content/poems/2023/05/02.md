Casting gleaming memory stones,  
On my path bellow my toes,  
To pick up when my wrinkles grow,  
A little more with passing hours,  
And faithful times will speak alone,  
Of a faithful father, friend, and throw...  
Me through the loop of memory hoops,  
To prance along the memory paths,  
And capture gleaming memory stones.
