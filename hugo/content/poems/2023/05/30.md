# 30.05.23
Month's end,  
The temporal path seems to fall away ahead,  
I see a days journey winding to the faded drop,  
Beyond it a fathomless expanse,  
It pulses with ancient vacancy,  
The time flows on afloat the horizon,  
I see the Month beginning anew,  
A solitary island beyond the shore of deepest time,  
It will be crossed in a blink when I dive off Month's end.
