{{< poem >}}
Holy anointed one,  
Be seated in your right place,  
Below my collar,  
Beneath my ribs and nestled in my innermost being,  
Deep above all in my heart,  
  
You are worthy,  
For you did not despise death,  
But bore the serpent's fangs as you crushed it once and for all,  
You alone can lay down Your life and pick it up again,  
So you are worthy, Son of David.
