{{< poem >}}
Baking a friendship,  
Risen in Christ,  
And sprinkled with questions and vulnerability,  
It's far better when you follow the divine recipe:  
Love for the other in service,  
Striving together for the prize - who is our Lord,  
And a respect for the fellow image bearer,  
It's so sweet yet it drips with contemplative complexity.
