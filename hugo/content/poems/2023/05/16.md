Installation adventures,  
To tap commands into a box,  
And watch the flowing symbols roll,  
Telling epics of a ceaseless searching,  
For files and files through thorny directories,  
Till they stitch together the needed code,  
And there it is: the fated program,  
To let me draw some pixel peeps,  
And maybe learn to make them walk,  
In pixel ways along the screen.
