{{< poem >}}
The sky is fog,  
And I pierce my hand into its depths,  
Yet I don't make it even half way through,  
But glance a trailing blow along its teeth,  
  
And - a little slower than a run - I turn to jog,  
Under the fathomless sky in all its breadth,  
And I feel my breath again renew,  
And trust the sturdy path beneath my feet,  
  
Although I only see a glimpse below,  
For the sky is fog.
