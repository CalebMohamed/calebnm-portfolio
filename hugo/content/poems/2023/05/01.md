# 01.05.23
Friendship for the rainy days,  
And talking work about work and torque,  
And other Physics theories and ways,  
Ways to think of floating dust,  
Ways to think of flying rays,  
And He is with me for all days,  
To be a friend, a help and laugh,  
To be a physics kid and walk his path,  
For me to smile in rainy days,  
In other houses where his kingdom advances.
