# 12.05.23
Green way,  
And the grey tattoo is hemmed in by lines of uninterrupted nature,  
The uniform scar stretches along the earth,  
As a myriad of green sways in the wind of hurtling tin cans,  
The dancing trees exude vitality to the point of near bursting,  
It's a strangly beautiful and upsetting sight,  
You are present to see such a vibrant sprawl...  
But the green way stands interrupted.
