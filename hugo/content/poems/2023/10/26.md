{{< poem >}}
Just a glimpse of Your face,
And I tremble beyond joy,
True love - the wisdom of God in a face,
Upon the dawning sun,
The radiance of the almighty,
Upon my beautiful one,
A special madness I hear,
A consuming hope, jealous as the God it flows from,
To see you in the noonday clear,
And we will be like you then.
