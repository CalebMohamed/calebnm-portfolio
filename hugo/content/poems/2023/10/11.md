{{< poem >}}
Faithful Father be praised!
You do not whisper to my heart in vain,
But for a cause I'm called,
To proclaim the gospel to the heights,
To mention your goodness to the depths,
To walk with your children between,
By grace we have a new life of purpose,
You do not whisper to our hearts in vain,
Faithful Father be praised!
