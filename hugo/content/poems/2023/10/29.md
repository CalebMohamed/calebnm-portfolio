# 29.10.23

I'm washed in lighted dark,
The neon signs do mark the sky,
And all the lights do clamour orange,
Above it all: the Pale Moon...
Glorious and pure in light splendid,
And the clamour is clear and rid beneath,
O holy one made known to me in whispers,
Has called to me in brilliant light,
That He alone stands pure and bright,
And all the lights beneath are simply noise and static.
