# 23.10.23

Computer Head with a heavy lean,
A croaking stool tucked far away,
In corners working noisily,
Tapping code and writing physics fast,
Drawing art with light-up mice in grasp,
Tumble to the kitchen now,
And lighting comes to fry a feast,
And strikes Computer Head to dance,
And watch him dance,
And smell the air,
The aromatic waft adraft,
Back to the stools and noisy screens,
Back to Computer Head with heavy lean.
