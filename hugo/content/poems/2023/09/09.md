{{< poem >}}
O' flow, Great River pouring forth,
At dayspring shattered dust beside,
At twilight echoed praise behind,
Fled is thirst, that wretched chain,
Fled my hollow pride and vain-,
Glory, love for drought and rage,
I thirst no more, I thirst no more!

Blue River, Yours are colours myriad,
Yours are truest beauty, full,
In pouring out Yourself on dust,
I thirst no more, I thirst no more!
