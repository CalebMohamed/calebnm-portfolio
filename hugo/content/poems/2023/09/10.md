# 10.09.23

Longest days that stretch the clock,
That make it creak within its span,
From morning to the dimming dusk,
Awake I am, awake I've been,
And stretch it with my eyelids open,
Now they try to shut on me,
At least the day is stretched not squashed,
For I love my toil, I love my rest,
I rejoice in one who blesses me,
With time that stretches,
With time sufficient for my needs.
