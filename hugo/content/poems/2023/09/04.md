{{< poem >}}
Scattered! The warmth of my rest place,
Unearth my bed, place far away,
I am setup upside down low,
And placed in other rooms beneath,

Lord, a fellow like me needs help,
To calm my heart when moving,
To know Your peace, Your time, Your plans,
Will hold me close when I see short,

Too short indeed, upset too fast,
I cannot see Your plans but still,
I'll rest on thee unmoving hill.
