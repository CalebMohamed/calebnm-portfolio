{{< poem >}}
Poems to share deep shallow reflections,
To call you to my mental world,
My map of language and shaped sound,
My blooming model for how things what,
Their names, their means, the people too,
I see them and I think and write,
The Lord, my Friend, my Shepherd too,
I see Him and I think and write.
