# 14.09.23

A barking dog punctuates the evening,
Textured chords on the flat darkness,
I saw the celestial assembly singing,
In silent praise they hummed last night,
Perhaps I'll see them bright again,
To what's ugly and begrimed lambasting,
To what's true and wholesome testifying,
Lord lift my mind to these heights of glory,
To see you there and return praising.
