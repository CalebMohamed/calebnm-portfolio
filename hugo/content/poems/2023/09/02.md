# 02.09.23

The stream runs hushed, Knock knock!
I stand beside - my Lord persists,
We're gated firm from rushing thought,
His hope diffused in my heart now,
Persistence grasps a deeper root I pray.

# Description

Talking to a friend about God again after a lot of conversations in the past. Praying that God would form in me the persistence of his Son who knocks.
