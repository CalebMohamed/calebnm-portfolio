{{< poem >}}
Blanket rain fall heavy in the dark,
Yet quiet whispers meet my weary ears,
For rain falls like the bore to deepest earth,
And I sit in castles up above their cries,
They water plants and drench the flies,
Yet I am warmed, my soul a mottled hearth,
By fire so glorious I know it'sÂ name.
