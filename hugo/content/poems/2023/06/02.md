# 02.06.23
Polychrome tactile chunks,  
Rattle round my head with style,  
Clicking down memory lane,  
To wisened corners twice dusted down,  
And now I grasp thee,  
Algorithm of the tactile breed,  
Turning with my fingers hastened,  
Till the polychrome mosaic sits still in tranquil rows...  
And I crush thee into squirming chaos,  
And rattle on with speed in tow.
