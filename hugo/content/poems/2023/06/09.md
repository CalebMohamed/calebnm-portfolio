{{< poem >}}
Tunnels come and cloak the train,  
To mirrors turn the windowpanes,  
In shadows cast they show the same  
Brothers sitting waiting still,  
One observing while the other chills,  
And out we come from tunnels drilled,  
Into the open sky alight,  
Dressed up in striking red tonight,  
And it falls away beneath the trees.
