{{< poem >}}
Loudest shirt,  
Drowns out the cannon balls,  
And flying water sprawled about,  
And all the laughter and stern sights,  
That lock on flying yellow spheres,  
Dived under by a shirtless bunch,  
That smile and hit wild crashing blows,  
On yellow balls that bounce above,  
And eclipse the sun...  
Yet even still the talking's drowned,  
Yet even still the great joyful cheers,
And dancing fall so quiet from: the loudest shirt.
