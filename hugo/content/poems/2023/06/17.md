{{< poem >}}
Reed nestled in my jaw,  
I try to form a pleasant tone,  
Yet a little squeak leaves near ears sore,  
Early practice is to bad notes prone,  
But it was just for fun nothing too hard-core,  
Just to know how my dad feels when in the zone,  
And blasting out great jazzy tunes through solid doors.
