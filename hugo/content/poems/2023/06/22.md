{{< poem >}}
True sun,  
Burning silent by the clouds,  
Enshrouded in the fog and cumulus high,  
I stare it in the eyes,  
And shaded just enough,  
I bare my gaze on its a few  
Seconds and the line is snapped.  
And looking down I feel its tap,  
On my shoulders as it breaks,  
Through the skyward net above.
