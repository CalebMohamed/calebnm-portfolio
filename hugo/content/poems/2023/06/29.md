# 29.06.23
Heavy halls,  
I'm told of weight so ancient here befalls,  
The stench of books and history told,  
Wafts viscous through the sun-lit streets,  
And words amount to tiny hills,  
That slot into the library walls.

# Description
Oxford Open Day Trip Today. I really enjoyed it but wanted to capture the interesting comment of a Second Year Maths student I talked to about the pressure in the grander libraries.
