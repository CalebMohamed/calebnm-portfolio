# 04.06.23
The sky's bleeding rose gold,  
It trickles through the leaves -  
Pooling in the darkness,  
And overwhelming the horizon with its heft,  
It tugs the colour from the sky,  
Leaving a fracture of white that fades into cotton candy blue,  
It melds into my mind,  
And I see it in my thoughts dripping like syrup off the edge of the world,  
Down into a devoid dreamland.
