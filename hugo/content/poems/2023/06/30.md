{{< poem >}}
Behemoth of the timeless dream,  
Why do I see see you clear on shores of cyclic Months?  
What haunted you to shatter dearest dreams?  
You encroach on concrete time, amiss,  
Bearing hues before the blandest reeds,  
Their seconds swaying ever same,  
Uniform beneath your fragile might,  
What horror draws you to the realised,  
That devours very possibilities you stand to hold at once,  
No...  
You wish to shatter time.
