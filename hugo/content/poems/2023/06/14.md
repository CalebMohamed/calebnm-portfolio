# 14.06.23
Winding paths,  
Converge into one,  
Like fleeting bursts they multiply like streams,  
Then they consolidate in a bustling walk,  
It pools at a reservoir,  
And people swim amalgamated with the rushing tide:  
Waltzers,  
Rapid rushers,  
Wandering walkers waking in a clockwork stew,  
And the dam bursts,  
And I'm flowing in the rapids now,  
And the creaking train beneath my feet is herald of a timely trip made once again.
