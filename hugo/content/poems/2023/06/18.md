{{< poem >}}
Block coloured sky descends again,  
Folding round the thick tree's edge,  
Blending it's turquoise and teal into shaded crevices,  
And at once the world outside is blue and humid.  
  
Playing with the fog beyond,  
It takes light strokes at far off folks,  
Tall austere greens are turned pale blue,  
And solid bark is pulled thin to fading wisps afar.
