# 21.06.23
Time to talk about my tongue today,  
Roaming round my mouth it stays,  
Inspecting all the teeth it says,  
Yet I just think it all day plays,  
And often sits still and obeys,  
When I just want to think away,  
The maths problem on the pristine board,  
That I shattered with my ordered numbers,  
Just like this very rhyme, you say?
