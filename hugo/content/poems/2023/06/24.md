{{< poem >}}
Loopy brain,  
To soupy turned a mind too sleepy,  
Now we talk in circled squares,  
About a time with ice cream gloopy,  
With stories told in wooden chairs,  
And just as well some benches creaky,  
Laughter follows through the air,  
To hearts laid bare and balls flown swiftly,  
Thank you Lord for answered prayer.
