# 05.06.23
Computers sitting in my days,  
Screens to hold maths, physics, code,  
Keyboards to freeze my many words,  
A mobile slab blasting tunes and plays,  
  
And they sit there humming in my days,  
Momentary corners filled in my abode,  
With flashing lights to tell me loads,  
Captivating info in the stalwart rays.
