# 03.06.23
Train game,  
And we sit around, lame,  
Unmoving by the table same,  
And pressing in for that family fame,  
Gotta grab those cards to lay down your lane,  
Expectant the nights watches through the pane,  
For us to laugh each others names,  
And maybe pull a funny faces or two...  
  
Or three.
