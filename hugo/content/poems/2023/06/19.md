# 19.06.23
Clocked off,  
Sun's taking a nap,  
Food's squished senseless,  
Feet trodden flat-  
  
-Lining air socks,  
Just vapourous, silly,  
Not really there like our imaginary friend Billy,  
And my thoughts roam free on the page,  
Someone call the sleepy-boy-sage,  
He's got some tired rhymes,  
When it's sleep times...  
Zzzzzzzzzz.
