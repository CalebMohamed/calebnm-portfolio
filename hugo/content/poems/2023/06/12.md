# 12.06.23
A soft glow lights the room,  
Periodic jolts fire across the splayed open circuitry,  
Pristine white folds into the crevices of the shaded cabinets before retreating like a receding tide,  
It flickers ceaselessly and is all at once still,  
  
"I think its fried"  
"Yeah I think so too"  
"Operations said something about a reactor meltdown and overclocking a thingy..."  
"Bah! We'll just reboot him tomorrow, usually works a charm"
