{{< poem >}}
The storm outside is wide and vast astride
My house, but kept behind closed doors for now,
Its peaking through in chasing cold: a peal
Of laughter striking from the clouds above,
A yellow glow that lamps the walls and lines 
My face and warms it in the chasing cold,
All's grey, but these are painted bright inside,
All's grey, but these are painted bright inside.
