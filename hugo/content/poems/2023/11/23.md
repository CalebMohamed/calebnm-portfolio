{{< poem >}}
I didn't have a poem,
But He called me then to pray,
Lord craft in me a poem,
Lord teach me what to say,

For I am like a desert,
That forgets its very thirst,
He'll show in me my needs,
And meet them ever first,

For I'll walk with him tomorrow,
Just as I have today,
And learn to not forget,
My need, my want, myÂ love.
