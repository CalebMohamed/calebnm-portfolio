I lie here still a little stifled,
O why, o why, do I fill my mind,
With endless lights and pointless troubles,

My glory and the lifter of my head,
Won't you save me from myself,
You are light and these are shadows,

This gluttony of the mind devours,
Help me cast it off in zeal, in power,
And still in quiet radiance,

Your radiance where I'm sated full,
Where I know peace, clarity true,
Where I'm lighter and enjoyÂ you.
