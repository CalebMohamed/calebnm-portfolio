Released unto the cityscape,
I am so small at large,
And join the bustle floating through,
If floating were my measured steps,
I am so small at large,
The clatter louder, louder still,
Through tunnels swallow space between,
I am so small at large,
And find a path through cityscapes,
To where I set to be.
