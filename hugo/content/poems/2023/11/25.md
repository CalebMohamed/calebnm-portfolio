# 25.11.23

Released unto the cityscape,
I am so small at large,
And join the bustle floating through,
If floating were my measured steps,
I am so small at large,
The clatter louder, louder still,
Through tunnels swallow space between,
I am so small at large,
And find a path through cityscapes,
To where I set to be.

# Description

Visited Josh's house in London. Took the national rail to London bridge and the jubilee line to Canada water and then a walk.
