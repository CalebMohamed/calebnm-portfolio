{{< poem >}}
I see so many faces,
Walking with me through the days,
Talking with me through the hours,
Cracking codes and solving puzzles,
Telling of their hopes and dreams,
Walking through the little things,
Then to run for on time trains,
Just to laugh between the breaths,
Of smoking air in busy streets,
This land that I am found within,
These days that mark my childhood.
