# 30.11.23

The aroma of Christ has come,
Make haste, make room,
He comes, He comes,
Dressing us with wisdom pearls,
Adorning us with holy tears,
He strikes our hearts for holiness,
He calls our names and future hopes,
He calls us out to greater things,
So I say to my Lord: Beautiful one, 
Compassionate and faithful is your name,
You are adorned with glory forever,
Have mercy on me, have mercy.
30.11.23
