I'm currently a second year undergraduate at Oxford reading Computer Science, and still living with my lovely
parents when not at Uni. I'm quite interested in models of computation and formal verification, and trying to read
some old books! I'm split between two beautiful churches
[Emmanuel Brighton][1] in the vacations and [Emmanuel Oxford][2]
in term time.

I'm still writing a poem everyday and at least one blog a week.
