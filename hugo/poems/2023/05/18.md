Three cranes loom in the sky,  
Backs crooked - scheming,  
They peer like kaijus from the heart of rolling cityscape,  
And aloft they stand,  
Watching busy creatures walk austere in shadows low,  
  
And standing under metal skies,  
Held together by rigid bars and pillars true,  
The busy creatures step in tune with blaring horns,  
That roll out from their metal frames,  
That glide along the iron lines.
