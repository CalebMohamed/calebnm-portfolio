Calmest vibrations,  
Translate the thoughts from one to another,  
And a listening ear opens hearts so soon,  
For many like to talk and talk,  
But never do they hear in truth,  
And still even talkers hide away,  
From their deepest want to be known and seen.  
  
For a glimpse of meaning in the midnight fog,  
Alludes the talker who knows no ear to hear,  
And runs from He who calls to listen.  
  
Hear ye,  
Hear ye,  
He seeks an open ear,  
To hear thy King,  
To hear thy fellow creature here below,  
And we shall see a glimpse of Him in the midnight fog,  
As we use these ears He gave us so.
