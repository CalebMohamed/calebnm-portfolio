Slowing down,  
And my body sways on the midnight river,  
Slow dancing on the rolling waves,  
All is calm in dreamer's town,  
On the open waterway my raft wobbles with a releasing shiver,  
I will find my vessel for another day docked and saved,  
And rest in truest hugs divine,  
That wrap me up in gentlest providence.
