Midnight crow out open in the day,
Your nightshade feathers shaped and cut,
Redeemed! Obsidian in the morning light, 
They glimmer as you sway,

Children of the luminescence,
You and I are clothed in might,
Not of our own, 
But known in amber rays,

For darkness was our chains,
Now as gemstones on our skin,
For shadows cannot hide from Him,
He'll clothe us just theÂ same.
