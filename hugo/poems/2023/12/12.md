Above meandering paths,
The sky remains the same,
Though crushing rain pours down,
And makes the air full brimming,
The sky above remains always,
Though ground transmutes to flowing mud,
Thick through the grey and fullest air,
The sky above holds tight the rain,
It's shall not cease to guide its stay.

**Oxford Interview Reflection**
Keble 1, 11:30AM
I...
Was not picking up,
What was being put down,
And came out with a frown.

Hertford 2, 5:50PM
Somewhere I have found a path,
But is it too meandering?
A farce. Hard to trace,
The extent of the matter, 
Through the vapour obscured,
But I took a path at least.
