# 11.12.23

The pressures of the day,
Wash ashore the bed of time,
And all that's left to say:
Is God is good at every line,
All unfolds as one long play,
Yet we hardly see its steady rhyme,
For the glipse I saw, I'll say:
God is good at every line.

# Description

It's only partly linked to the Oxford interview I did today, but just wanted to catalogue what happened today here: 
Hertford 1, 2.50:
Good times,
Hard times,
Stuck unstuck and stuck,
Writing digitally quick,
Reckoning with questions that elude.
