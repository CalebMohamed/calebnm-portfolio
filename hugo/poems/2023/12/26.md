The joy of bubbles rediscovered,
At popping and preserving: jubilation,
To look on perfect prisons suspended,
Holding in the melted colours,
Infusing them with curves and boundless roiling,
They seem to melt the light beside,
Entrancing it to bow and blend,
With colours 'till it paints the maelstrom with its brightness,
And halos the edge with specular shine.
