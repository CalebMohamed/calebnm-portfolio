# 06.12.23

I like a gentle blue,
That treads along the edge of green,
And sets for muted hues instead,
A blue thats murky then untamed,
A vibrant tropic depth beneath,

It wanders besides dispassionate orange,
Lightly wound like barricade tape,
Into itself till hotness boils,
At edges frayed and licked with blue,
This hotness drains and leaves a fiery stillness mute,

They seem to brush but never mix,
They seem to dance but never to a tune,
They seem to leap about but crash and sway at the extent of the other,
I like a gentle blue,
And dear ochre that joins it in its waiting.
