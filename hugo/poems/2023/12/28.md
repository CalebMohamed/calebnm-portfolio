# 28.12.23

Like flowing currents in a warm stream,
This molten tiredness drifts beneath my skin,
And my mind wanders like a dream,
It pulls me into muddled half-way hot,
The ripples tall as I dip through the froth like cream,
It pools in steady pools like sunken thoughts,
I stand to the side and breathe the steam.
