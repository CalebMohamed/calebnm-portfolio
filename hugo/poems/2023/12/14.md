# 14.12.23

Light as water drips down the banister,
Rippling with moving shadows at my passing,
It pools beneath the lamps and seems to spray the stairs,
Never soaking, ever foaming,
A careful tide beside my jagged perch,
Ever high and never receding,
Flowing in yet filling not the floor,
I turn to scoop the flowing bright,
My hand is drenched in warmer pools,
Over there! Moving shadows at my passing.
