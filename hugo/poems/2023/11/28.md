# 28.11.23

Sharing music once again,
It's words in hidden alphabet,
Phrases calling out to soul,
And glory for The Highest One,
He distilled beauty into frequencies,
And let's us dance to merry tunes,
And let's us think to gentle jazz,
And let's us praise Him in this meaning,
In these hidden alphabets.
