I close my eyes and see the black,
Then formless patterns in the dark:
Great jagged lines and rolling hills,
From deep beyond my formless thought,
My mind a theatre of disrupted lines,
That play the fool in checkered falls,
That tumble into swarms of light,
That fray great epics into seconds,
They echo at attentions call:
Bygone, bygone.
