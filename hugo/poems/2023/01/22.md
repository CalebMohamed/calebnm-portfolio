You placed a heavy weight on my life,  
A calling to higher places,  
But it's not like other weights,  
It's gentle still in hard spaces.  
  
Seems to pull me heavenward,  
It makes me light and bubbly,  
And its fuel for my days:  
A basic necessity.  
  
I can't wait for it Lord,  
You know its just an expression,  
So I'll wait here in your presence,  
Keep me humble and escaping,  
  
The evil one, he's prowling,  
But you'll use it for my good,  
Refining metal in the furnace,  
Till you take me with quickly packed cases.  
  
Wherever it may be...
