# 31.10.23

All hallows'eened,
You guessed it...
You've been Eugene'd,
These spooks that are seen,
These bats, skulls and fiends,
Make me want to glean,
Why with spiderman death has been,
And we try to scare ourselves mean,
It makes me think - which I do like to do,
Why brother John chose these words, just a few:
Perfect love casts out fear.
-Eugene DeGooseman
