# 19.10.23

Great passion of my soul,
You pluck the strings of my depths,
So my song is more beautiful than my own,
In the night, chaos and obscurity,
Your wisdom commands me,
Through my heart I know instruction,
To dwell on your face, to dwell on your face!

You have my lot, Lord have it all,
My unbelief will not stand long,
For I know my redeemer lives.
19.10.23
