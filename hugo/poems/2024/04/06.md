# 06.04.24

So much hair falls loosely to the floor,
Bunched up in hived off little cliques,
They giggle in their wavy waves,
They are at last free from my head,
To wander off to lands uncharted,
To meet their chauffeurs in yellow brightness - 
Dustmen in their hardy suites,
Dustmen wearing diligence like flourescent bands,
Off they go to lands uncharted.
