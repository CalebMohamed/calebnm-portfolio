My resting place in mountain halls,
By pillars of deep basalt weeping,
Tears of love a mingled magma,
My hiding place and fortress rock,
O Lord my God my resting place,
My portion now and never gone,
Far further than the crust falls still,
Far further than the mountains fold,
Far further than the valleys and the seas roll up,
You will remain farther than the rocks,
And you have given me rest.
