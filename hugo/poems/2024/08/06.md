Once again I set out to carve,
A place upon the face of information,
Falling with a vigour as if to starve,
The mind of gaps amidst the murmuration,

To find a dusty cleft to call a far off home,
To set a window looking to the waterfall,
Call out to weary travellers now to roam,
From storefronts to my garden wall,

The rock is thick. I too see why,
So few have ventured carving out a place,
This side of all the petty information lusting for our time.
