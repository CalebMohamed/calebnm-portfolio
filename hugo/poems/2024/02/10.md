# 10.02.24

O the sweetness of worship,
Like water to the desert sand,
Sweet honey glowing off the comb,
That fills up your belly with assurance,
_Surely all things are as they should be,_
_Before the throne in spirit and in truth,_
_Surely all things are as they should be,_
_Surrended at the altar where our Father smiles._
10.02.24
