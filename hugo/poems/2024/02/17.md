# 17.02.24

I wish to write a nonsense poem,
For I've reasoned through the day,
I've straighten out spaghetti code,
And wrinkled up my brain,

So now I shall describe the feeling,
Of misstepping on the stairs,
When all is dark and the well falls short,
A step from what you thought before,

Oh tumble up and over yonder,
Your sole stomps down and shin asunder,
At least it feels so in the night,
You lay there in a dazzled plight,

This misstep of an upward fall,
This hubris shattered as the glass,
This clattered mirror of the world,
That holds just one step many in your eyes.
