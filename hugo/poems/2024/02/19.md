# 19.02.24

The lights of far-off spaces,
Washing streets and steel fireplaces,
Dipping marbles in the hue,
Bringing out their winking blue,
Licking gold on bygone planets,
Washing out the slabs of granite,
The lights of far-off spaces,
Glow bright crown jewels of nature's faces,
These eyes and mirrors of glory beyond.
