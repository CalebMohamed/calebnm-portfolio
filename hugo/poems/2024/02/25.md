# 25.02.24

Full of years with old man ears,
With plenty stories folded up in handkerchiefs,
Of days gone back and adventures,
Adventures in a world so different yet the same,
Same toil and rush,
Same hearts and minds,
Same need for something more than age will give,
Though give a lot I'm told it does.
