# 25.11.24

What gift it is to ruminate,
On all the ages in the soil,
Their books in shelves so near,
My burning curiosities placate,
Upon the abstract, the vast, the royal,
First eternal consolation to the gadgets of the year.
25.11.24

Heard about Boethius' The Consolation of Philosophy and found a free online copy.
