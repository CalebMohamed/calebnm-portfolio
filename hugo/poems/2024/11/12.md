# 12.11.24

I see you stand intent,
To fill my head with proofs,
Give lemmas in their plenties,
Comingling with force to stand,
Up then - a deck of cards,
Tethered upwards by wax wings,
Ascending with but fleeting dreams,
I thought the pillars card but no:
Encased in stone, those which,
Ungrounded show the ground,
Much higher than I saw.

Revised 13.11.24
I see you stand intent,
To fill my head with proofs,
Give lemmas in their plenties,
Comingling with force to stand,

Up then - a deck of cards,
Intricately groomed to the point of horror,
Tethered to the heavens in conspicuous vainglory,
Ascending upon wax wings,

I thought the ornate pillars card but no:
Encased in stone, those which
Ungrounded show the ground,
Much higher than I saw in ignorance.
