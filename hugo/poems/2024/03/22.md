# 22.03.24

Musical madness,
And all these walking melodies,
That wander to and fro upon the frets,
That mark mathematical sequence on the page,
That turn a motif into a movement,
And scatter like mist into their many permutations,
Musical madness,
A gift I get to hear from nations here and there,
From nations I have never seen.
