# 20.03.24

Twenty sum three,
One unit fallen short,
These leaning sticks on sticks,
Strike out a pose amongst the trees,
Just short the canopy of twenty four,

Alas 
   they 
    crash.

They tumble to the gates of time,
"Wait just once!" the clock chastised,
"You take up size like mounting cries,
It shan't be long to reach the ears of suits and ruling ties."
