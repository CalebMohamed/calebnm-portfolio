# 14.03.24

Tests that turn out better,
Glady swinging into fun,
Cruel tricks to gentle teasers,
Friendly symbols in a sea
Of foreign words befuddled,
Even those dastardly questions,
That hide their shades behind
My incompetence hold signs,
To give a flash of inspiration
To hopeful shots into the night.

# Description

I think you are owed an explanation lest I wheezy laugh to the grave:

I had a physics test today that went way better than expected. To help clarify the last part, I was playing on shots in the dark -> shots into the night
