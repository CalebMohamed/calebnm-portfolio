# 06.03.24

Coming now to journey's end,
I feel like I've done back-forth laps,
Sprinted till my hands and feet are golden paws,
I'm panting now just gone the line,
At last complete: now to ball up and snore.

# Description

Imagery: when I was younger my Great Aunt had a golden retriever called Ruby, that would run ahead of us and then come back.

I've finally finished my computer science coursework and I've done significantly more than the normal amount, so it feels like I've been a back and forth dog that has finally come to the end of a journey.
