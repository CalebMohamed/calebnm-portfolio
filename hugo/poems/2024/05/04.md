# 04.05.24

Clawing up the learning curve,
To find a little hope inside the mess,
Of half-way thoughts half-memories,
Of gaps in confidence and skill,
I found a meager cleft within the face,
To take a moment of reprieve and lace,
My breath with a slightest hint of awe,
Of where I've dragged myself to be,
Hold just wait - it isn't yet complete,
Until I acknowledge He -
He who set me up to climb,
Who knows what being me is like,
Far deeper than I know myself,
To Him be the glory for the things I make,
For all the genius and lack there of,
For all these fields and cliffs I find.
