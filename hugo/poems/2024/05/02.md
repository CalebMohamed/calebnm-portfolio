# 02.05.24

Three feathered of a kind,
Find purchase on a powerline,
A quiet elder to younger opined:

"The urbanisers made their nests,
Of shiny things and smoothest rocks,
To call us measly lowly pests,
But many kind do share their bricks."

Now dither not the three ascend,
Onto the wind and distance rend,
From time and seam it back again,

"Come dear child and see the trees,
Here see powerlines and little suns,
Once lean now fills the space with green,
And interleaves the urban run."

Now dither not the three do land,
To muddy paths by fields so grand,
That come to find the face of forest pan.

"Learn to dance and scatter in the way,
To fly and hop by beauty at the meadow,
To frit about by busy creatures don't delay,
Come see the urbanisers and their shadows."
