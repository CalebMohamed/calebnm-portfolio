# 01.05.24

The bulwark of my curiosity,
This canvas hanging on the wall,
And likewise countless through the ages,
A far time stone then black and white,
Come bare these workings on your coat,
Come take on symbol and this meaning,
Come solve with me my many proofs,
I scribe a script - you write on me,
An exposition of reason intertwined,
I look to see what we have made:
A saga in black characters.
