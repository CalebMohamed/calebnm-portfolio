# 06.05.24

I heard the banks do take their naps,
Though many moons are far between,
Unceasing pensions doled and all the rest,
Transactions cheques all flutter like the leaves,
Such ancient oak - a bastion never sleeps...
Except for when it does and all the bustle
With it takes a pause.
Though many stragglers find their feet
Still trotting on in learning or in errands
Never halting lest they fall behind... or...
Drop.
