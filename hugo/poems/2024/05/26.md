# 26.05.24

A poem for the road,
Away from rainy westland,
Amidst the bold assertions of the sun,
Between the blowing bouts of rain,
Beside the verdant countryside again,
Becoming deeper entrenched in vibrant reality,
Culminating in great golden fields,
Crossing by the grassy hills like sleeping giants,
Creasing hills into their lumpy folds.
