# 17.05.24

Man in the mirror,
I can hardly remember when you were not so,
It seems the tides of time have washed your face,
Like sand you've slimmed imperceptibly,
Like sand it's dragged away the marks of youth,
Yet I see a sparkle in your eyes,
As shiny rocks that glimmer in the water's wake,
You are becoming yet become,
And if He wills I'll watch the wisdom mark your face,
In creases 'till I hardly remember when you were not so.
