# 03.12.24

Uncoiling now and winding down,
Taught string relaxed, spring opened out,
In gliding dips the pressure rounds,
Near to the bottom of the well,
Within the rhythm of a fast paced life,
I'll find alloted time to rest.

This week's supposed to be quite intense but most of my deadlines are frontloaded and I'm ahead on others so I'm starting to relax a bit. Which is quite nice really.
