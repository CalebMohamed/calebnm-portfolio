# 22.06.24

Laying out a scaffolding of logic,
Carving out the thinking face in lines of code,
He looks at me an image of my thoughts,
He looks at me an image of my play,
My play with words far more constrained,
By reams of logic spooling into chains,
To hold me in a puzzle and imprint,
My quizzing and tomfoolery - my burst of creativity.
