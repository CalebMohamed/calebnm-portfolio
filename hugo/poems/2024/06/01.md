# 01.06.24

The thought of time,
As months tick up like all their little seconds just the same -
If spending be a true image of the thing,
I hope to spend you well.
But maybe humility would better ask,
That You would help me far from sin that mar the time,
That You would make my backbone strong to sit in quietness,
That you would teach my heart to want your ways,
For they make good the time,
For they make good the time.
