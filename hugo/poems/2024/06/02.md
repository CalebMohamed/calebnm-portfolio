# 02.06.24

A practiced fluency that I've gained,
To walk in languages and symbols vast,
To follow steps of giants in the wake 
Of history and its captivated minds.

Their fantasy and genius care to show,
In objects of reason borne in Greek script,
Wrapped up in varied meanings -
A model of computation and its simple alphabet.

Oh the winding spools of tape that coil upon the winds,
Drawn out beneath these marching machines -
Automata of the dreamy kind.
