# 17.06.24

Well goodbye my eager pictures,
Your tale is ancient and refactored time again,
But I shall place you down and find another lens,

I've grown accustomed to your fixtures,
Neatly on walls and sketched out in pages,
Your quaint flames and beams and glassy gauges,

I shall replace them with great whirring metal,
Your successor or at least a retold tale,
Drawn in silicon - a truly eclectic portrayal.
