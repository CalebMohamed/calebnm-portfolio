# 29.06.24

Travel trouble,
Dumbfounded in the wrong location,
Lights out no sparse communication,
But the trouble starts to simmer,
My finger pointed in the mirror,
Why can't I read the little print,
Right there! The middle muddled int-
-erspersed in all the email text,
And all of me but none the world perplexed,
A humble even quiet call to be somewhere else entirely.

I got there on time in the end.
