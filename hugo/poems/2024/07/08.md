# 08.07.24

Fuller rain makes fresh the air,
Upon the twighlight without care,
The day is up and all the world is fuller,
The night has neatly lined with silver,

The glory of the meeker roar,
That gladens soil and farmer more,
Calling to the resting soul at hand,
Come feel the grace and might of God,
See mighty patterns - understand.
