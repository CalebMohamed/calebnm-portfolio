# 15.07.24

Deafened by the rain,
It pours incessant down in streams,
Like roiling flood dragons bearing silver fangs,
Like great anvils to the feet of gongs,
They rattle and I wish to stand amongst the noise,
Pour out myself amidst this majesty,
For He is Lord and I am ruined,
He holds me as I fall beside the thudding rain.
