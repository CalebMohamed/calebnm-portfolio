# 06.07.24

Roaring lions valiant in a row,
Caught up in ritual combat on the green,
To fight from down behind and low,
Bellows puffing in a heated row,
They take a toll of time till every drop,
Of sweat beads down their rivals brow,
Which pleads the stifled foe to stop.
For the game is lost and wons.
