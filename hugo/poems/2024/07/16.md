# 16.07.24

Inequality but not the tragic kind,
Instead invoke the nifty sign,
Familiar to some and strange to most,
An echo of a crocodile's boast,
I scarce care for crocodile meals,
Instead just how he stomachs all the reals,
How does he flip and intersect,
Under my full arithmetic set,
Inequality but not the tragic kind,
Instead invoke the nifty sign.
