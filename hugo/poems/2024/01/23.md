I'm transported to a rainy world in blue,
The sky is shaded mint - the drops of rain a gentle hue,
To dash the world in reverie,
The verdant meadow splashes new,
Like watercolour on the air above,
A turquoise in the lazy droplets,
Glistening the grass like morning dew,
Abandon and a reckless walk,
To feel the falling rain strike softly on my hair,
To spend a moment as the pitter patter,
To watch it colour glasses sparkling and blue,
To patter by the dreamy view.
