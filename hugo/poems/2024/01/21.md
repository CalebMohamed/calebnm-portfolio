# 21.01.24

Hello sweet eyes,
I see you heavy in the day,
But through you I see smiles,
Full weeks and setting Suns,
Speckled artfully by the way,
I see the world its beauty when it's cold,
The rising Sun flow lazy through the trees,
This land I live within a play,
It calls - beckons me to live to full,
To wade through heavy sight to see,
Glory as a man,
Who meets me as I pray.
