# 27.01.24

Eigenvectors,
Do walk along the threads of space,
They see the stars grow old and die,
Yet do not err their course long set,
Such proper fellows marching on,

Where to I ask - where to they know,
They do not share their mysteries,
For in sharing one has walked their path,

Such paths that put such words to shame:
As far, long, weary alabaster,
Shattered early on their very road -

Eigenvectors,
Do walk along the threads of space,
They see the stars grow old and die,
Yet do not err their course long set,
Such proper fellows marching on.

# Description

Eigenvectors - in linear algebra (the maths of coordinates systems, directions, and the transformations of one direction/point to another), Eigenvectors are the characteristic directions of a transformation that remain in the same direction after the transformation. If you consider the rotation of a cube on its corner, there is one line that isn't changed by the spinning on the corner: the line which the object spins around. I was learning about it in preparation for the lessons I'll have next week on it.
