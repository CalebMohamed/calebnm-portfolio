# 01.01.24

I'll be down the stairs,
Not fully through but on.
And on I search for words in pairs,
But quickly I am gone,
Back up the stairs for all my cares,
Whisk me away to laughter's song,
To share a thought and off be down the stairs.

# Description

The staircase to my room is separate from the one to my Parents'. I read them my poems before bed and often interrupt my writing to rush up and talk to them before returning to the stairs.
