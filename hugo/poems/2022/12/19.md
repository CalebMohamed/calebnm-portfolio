Shattered clouds fall,  
In a downpour of fragrant gemstones,  
Resounding like a flowing tide,  
Blaring a horn at their descent,  
And in a moment whispering.  
  
Loud and quiet like a wandering melody,  
Vibrant and cautious like the patting of tiny feet,  
They cover the earth in depths and shallows,  
Pouring out from the heavens.  
  
All the world rejoices,  
For it rains on the righteous and the wicked,  
And His grace calls out like rushing waters,  
To turn from their darkness and dance in the rain with Him.
