Changing cars like new socks,  
Changing friends like old shoes,  
Oh the wild insanity,  
Oh the deep insatiability,  
To empty your mind to fill it with rubbish,  
Too empty for peace,  
Too empty for solace.  
  
Changing cars like new socks,  
Changing your mind like old bedsheets,  
Oh the crushing confusion,  
Oh the fathomless folly,  
To speak double lies to wear double faces,  
Too loud for advice,  
Too loud for still places.  
  
Oh Prince of Peace,  
Change our every allegiance,  
To bow at your feet,  
And find sweet release.  
  
To change when in want,  
And help those in need,  
To sow fields of great friendship,  
And kneel silently.
