My days are closing in,
This time condensed to heavy clouds,
These sounds layered to choking revs,
Yet awe still stands upon the spires,
Defiant to the passing years,
Cold stone built up in reverence,
To cast one's gaze above such fears.

6 comes 1 x 2 x 3
With a little shake its 1 x 2 + 3
Squaring off each side by side: 5² 5 5²
