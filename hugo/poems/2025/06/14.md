Tumble bumbled rumble,
A cyclic siphon sifting,
Speaks in spattered spills,
Mouths around a clustered cloth,
The time is leisurely to clock,
Departing at the same,
Returning plenty late,
But warmly dry.

Laundry, Shop, Cook
Little drum and little guitar
Inspired podcast - very sad
Teddy dinner, study party
Drunk hertfordians
Sleep
