Pink petals crown the leaking heart,
So summoning from shallow wounds,
The direst pain. To barely bear,
A naked flame in passing hours,
Rose carnations bloom.

Hard IP and IPS exam, did not know the content nearly well enough for IPS and IP was really hard. Lots of mental block, loud cheering outside, hot room. Very humbled.
