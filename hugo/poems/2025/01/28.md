# 28.01.25

A march through many lands,
Sight seeing in the up-tilt breaths,
Which punctuate long dips into the abstract realm,
Where all is meddling with notes - a striving to conceptualise,
At times berated with sematic walks,
In others lonely witnessing long prose,
Yet others in an open discourse of ascent,
What a pilgrimage this is!
