# 03.01.25

If I were a squire,
Upon the tails of olden days,
If I were a journalist,
Enthralled in all the city and its thrust,
If I were a humble monk,
Thinking on the mysteries of all:

I'd have a different page to mark,
My words would veer through countries far,
I'd have a plot to chase through streets of glass,
Yet here I sit at the end of whimsy,
I'd see the world remains as bright as always was,
I have my words to write.
