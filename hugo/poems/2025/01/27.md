# 27.01.25

Condescension from the highest peak,
The lofty mount that pats the head of distant space,
Transcending all of time and every whisper of decay,
Our Lord from there descends.

And folding every pristine robe,
Firmly placing down eternal jewels,
Collapsing glory into feeble frame,
To sit in dust with us!
