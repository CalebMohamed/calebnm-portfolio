# 20.01.25

Gathering the saints our feet in morning dew,
Awash in echoes 'neath grand beams,
Enrapt with faces stained in glassy light,
Sternly huddled in wide open rooms,

Like incense wafting ceaseless through,
Piercing Heavens to attentive courts,
And ever this will be our praise:
Our hearts poured out and hope hung up on You and always You.
