# 02.01.25

Old friends become so new again,
When right there face to face,
Their breath so warm it'd bargain -
With the air. It'd fill with fog the space,
And laced in every passing vapour,
Far-spoken 'ventures on this fledgling race.
02.01.25

The condensing breath of friends, and all their adventures at Uni before we head back for our 2nd terms.
