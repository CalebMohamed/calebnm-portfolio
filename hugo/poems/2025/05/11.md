The sprawling city is in light and shadow,
Elevated pillars - pensive stonework,
Scar the valiant onslaught from the Sun,
Leaving pleasant trenches on the unturned tiles,
The heat of day at bay, though strangely sparse,
The people are elsewhere, and Hermes
Frozen in gold gives pause to his same quest and braves the heat.
