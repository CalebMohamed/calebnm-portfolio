Play beside the setting sun,
Painterly, a drama for the bell-
-y, filling up on weary drink:
The madness of dear friends.

A tragedy without reprieve,
No villain schemer dastardly,
But as the violent depths to turn,
The worthless things to polished stone,
No evil thing, no justice bent,
A crime without a criminal,
A fiddle without care for rhyme,
Just leaves a stifled hollow vast,
In place of sorrow cutting fast.
