The last strand enwound within a stripe of vigor,
The petals fall a little saddened in the shady afternoon,
But as if in such a vibrant act of deepest hope,
In love of Life and shunning sin and death rebels,
Such beauty in a smile it'd bloom in its near-bowing stoop.

Visited Grandma today, she is very old and frail. In pain the whole time, no words said, hardly heard at all. But we shared the sweetest smile and she kissed me on the cheek.
