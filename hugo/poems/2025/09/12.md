O little creature by the lake,
Come wrap now in vermillion wools,
For in the ripple of its folds,
A face, no doubt, is surly long.

With a stagnant malcontent,
The stillness is a deathly cool,
That leans too full upon the soul,
And dips the heart in ill-fit dread.

You, O little one, are for the wools,
Which cover you from head to soles,
Which cast in worlds unsaid a happy scene,
Not mirrors but a peak through nitted thread,
At home without this weary selfward gaze.
