The golden light mounts thick on evening haze,
In parting leaves and comely wheat, the world,
And all between sits overbrimming full.
The beauty of the winking hour's flush,
Falls like a fever in the early spring,
So hot and freezing cold - why must it end when I begin?
Why does the beauty fade so soon?
Why do such beauties flame in gold?
Why would it ever soot or snuff or fall to stagnant coals?
O You unfaded light and golden days!
How could You let these fall to deepest night,
But I have seen your grace, though it dismays.
I will lift up Your praise O faithful light,
So merciful and glorious, what love,
His arm ever outstretched though we despise.
