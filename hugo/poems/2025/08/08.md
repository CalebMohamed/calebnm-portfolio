A little splash within your lives,
And I'm deep within the pool again,
We're in this same time-frozen place,
I've watched us age and change so fast,
Our humours come and go in somewhat style,
But I pray our warmness never cools,
I hope that I will leave such ripples as to waft,
Towards the shores of grace and selfless love.
