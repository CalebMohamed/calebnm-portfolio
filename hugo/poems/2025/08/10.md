I'm finding fun with you my kin and friends,
Deep at the bottom of all childhood dreams,
All pools and safe-depths conquered to each inch,
Perhaps we'll try some cards down here in the,
Unfriendly unders - we'll bask in cyan rays,
Such speckled lights upon our frozen glares,
Deep in the balance of the air and careful hands.

Played cards with kieren and fern under water. We spent like 11 hours together today.
