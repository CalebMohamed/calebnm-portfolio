# 20.03.25

Unfettered in a bird's-eye flight,
Gliding to the corners of the earth,
To see the familiar and the strange,
Large seas of tarmac, rusting ribs of buried titans,
Multiplexing circuits carved upon the plains,
Turning back to rugby fields and cordoned woods,
To yawning Sussex arching on the Downs.
