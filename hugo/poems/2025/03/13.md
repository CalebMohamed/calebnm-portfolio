# 13.03.25

Dancing lights at the call of a haloed moon,
The chilly overheating, the sober headache and forgetting,
The staggering humanity lining the streets like cilia,
The night grows old and festers to its silent buzz,
Why are you hidden, pied piper?
Care to share your hideous beauty with the evening air?
