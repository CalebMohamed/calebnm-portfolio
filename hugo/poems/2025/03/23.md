# 23.03.25

Facing all our frailties,
Our strength comes frivolous and spent,
Our minds unbearably slow,
And footing inches from the empty air,
Where shall we turn but to Him still?
Our grounding and severest bet,
Our wager on eternity:
On goodness, peace and hope,
On our strong terror and assured ransom,
On divine reason that mutes the dragon.
