When all my waking seeks to sleep,
Curling at the edge of estranged self,
To fall within the arms of half oblivion,
Repose's false son: thief of evening light.

Back to Oxford, still finding situation quite hard mixed with low sleep. No work done today, time with Thomas but no deep sharing. I'm scared to ask but I think it's quite clear on reflection that they are together.
