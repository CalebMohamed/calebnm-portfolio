The world I'd love to share,
Gives tactile form to fantom gears,
Like clockwork rendered with a pen,
All its life is both so you and yet transcends,
You're ever facing reason in so grand a match:
The folly and the wisdom,
The roadblock and eureka,
The apprehension and abandon,
It seems too strange and yet rings true,
That I am just myself but so estranged in these deep games.
