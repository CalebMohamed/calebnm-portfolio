Within the trenches of my room,
The war mundane drags stubbornly,
"With this fine play we take the flank,
Clear every violent box and plank,
The floor, its ours! So clear and free..."
But merely they have taken to a deskspace-loom.

I keep my room tidy, I promise! It's just that i have all my uni stuff in boxes everywhere since we don't have storage space for it T-T
