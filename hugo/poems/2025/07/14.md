Violent winds and smokey skies,
Become a fated audience above,
The unmoved hills which fix themselves,
A sliver of the starlight for a coat.

At moment ceaseless drops take pause,
In time for all the whispers of the trees,
The sky too stills like unpolished marble,
I find in it a simple peace.

An epic of a day
19-24s seminar
Morning meeting
Henry Arrived
Great shared lunch
Very fun walk around the whole of the lake - really beautiful and varied
Evening service
Went back to cook with Alice and Rachel
Bit hectic with rain and moving stuff to bbq area (Rachel was very hangry)
Finally got it all ready for eating at like 22:50
Then chairs, teeth and finally poem
