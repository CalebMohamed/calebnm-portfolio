Each corner of this human condition,
All mysteries of strength and servitude,
Of lowliness and rumbling renoun,
Find final glory in one glorious life,

Our Lord perfecting this limped gait of ours,
Swept up from womb to roman cross and grave,
Through laughter and great sorrows' claws,
He took the depths of us and set them true.

Makes ways through obscure towns like quiet men,
