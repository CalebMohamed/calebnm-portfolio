With the open heavens for choice,
With each galactic throne to greet,
You choose to not withhold your voice,
To make this tiny tent your seat,
O You, Great God, are greater than all words,
For you make mighty men of weak,
That you would shame all things that are,
With that that's not but humbly seeks.
