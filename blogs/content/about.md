Hi, I'm Caleb Mohamed, a 19 year old from the South of England. I'm currently studying Computer Science at the
University of Oxford. I love Jesus, music, maths, and poetry (well, maybe just writing them).

I was born in Brighton, then swiftly escaped to the sleepy countryside 30 minutes North, until returning for A
Levels and church. Since then, I've been off adventuring beneath picturesque spires and looming gargoyles until the present!

I'm still woefully ill-informed about the vast world of Computer Science but have dipped my toes in: a little
game dev, a little graphics programming, some web dev, functional programming, and neovim although I am quite
the noob.
