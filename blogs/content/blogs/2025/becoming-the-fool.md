I love programming because it reminds me that **I'm the fool**.

The butt of the joke. The one out of the loop.

It's strange really, the embarrassment I can feel at my silly
mistakes when coding. There isn't any social pressure. *No one
else is watching.* But that's the heart of it. Coding wonderfully
exposes my own impatience and arrogance when, at the end of
every error, lies the same culprit: yours truly. 

It causes some really sober moments of reflection about how 
quickly I complexify issues, begin to suspect others (in the
form of libraries, hardware and the like), and delay in 
finding myself at fault until the final moment. Ok maybe that 
last one is a bit of an exaggeration - I've come to know that 
I'm usually the one at fault, but still find it easy to doubt 
that when I'm stuck for a while.

Some people say that golf is the most humbling sport, but
I think that programming in a language you only
half understand takes the cake for me.

The most humorous cases are when I've solved non-existent
problems and have to bin my work. They train a kind of 
resilience where you learn to throw away (sometimes) hours of work for a 
much simpler and better solution. Oftentimes, just a little
checking of documentation - or more honestly a ChatGPT prompt -
and I would have found a built-in feature instead of doing
it myself.

The most recent example has been the color themes I've
set up on this site. I swap out two css variables for the
primary and secondary accents, which then style the whole page
(like how home is rose and blogs here are cyan). I wrote
a little script which does this quite neatly and did the
plumbing to call it on load for each page, and made sure that 
my hugo links the generated blog pages to the right scripts and
such, all to discover that, to my horror, there is a css
feature where you can toggle a section of css with an html 
property. To make matters worse the js calls after the first 
style, so the colours flicker to the default first!

Hopefully, all of this madness *refines my character or
something*.

Anyways, back to fools.

For a while, I've found the archetype of the [wise fool][1]
really interesting. It's a horrible affront to intellectual 
pride and I just find the ideas viscerally compelling:
- *for all our learning, it seems the fool was right after all*
- *oh look, I guess sometimes you just stumble into the right answer*
- *the fool in his folly speaks the truth without fear*
- *he who we despised was the greatest of us all*

I especially like the Judeo-Christian paradox of wisdom: only the 
foolish consider themselves wise. Alternatively, only
the wise consider themselves foolish.

It also plays wonderfully into the realities of humour. 
Often the best humour comes from someone playing the fool:
not considering themselves too high and mighty to be the
butt of a joke.

Anyways, this is quite a scattering of thoughts on
the topic of fools, but I will leave you with the
gorgeously haunting visage of [Sta≈Ñczyk][2]
as he ponders the capture of Smolensk.
