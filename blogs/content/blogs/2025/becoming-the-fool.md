I love programming because it reminds me that **I'm the fool**.

The butt of the joke. The one out of the loop.

Its strange really, the embarassment I can feel at my silly
mistakes when coding. There isn't any social pressure. *No one
else is watching.* But that's the heart of it. Coding wonderfully
exposes my own impatience and arrogance, when at the end of
every error lies the same culprit: yours truly. It causes
some really sober moments of reflection about how quickly
I complexify issues, begin to suspect others (in the form
of libraries, hardware and the like), and delay in finding
myself at fault until the final moment.

Some people say that golf is the most humbling sport, but
I think that programming in a language you only
half understand takes the cake for me.

The most humourous cases are when I've solved non-existant
problems and have to bin my work. They train a kind of 
resilience where I learn to throw away (sometimes) hours of work for a 
much simpler and better solution. Often times just a little
checking of documentation - or more honestly a chatgpt prompt -
and I would have found a built-in feature instead of doing
it myself.

The most recent example has been the color themes I've
set up on this site. I swap out two css variables for the
primary and secondary accents which then style the whole page
(like how home is rose and blogs here are cyan). I wrote
a little script which does this quite neatly and did the
plumbing to call it on load and make sure that my hugo
links the generated blog pages to the write scripts and
such, all to descover that to my horror there is a css
feature where you can toggle a section of css to change
such things with an html property. To make matters worse
the js calls after the first style, so the colours flicker
to the default first!

Hopefully, all of this madness refines my character or
something.
