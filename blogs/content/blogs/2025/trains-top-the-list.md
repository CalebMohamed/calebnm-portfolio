Out of all methods of transport, trains top the list. And, funnily enough, I'm on a train right now.

I love watching the world go whizzing by, the hum of raw industrious power, the peace that comes with sitting for a time with few disturbances. You're seated in a hurtling mass of human ingenuity, flying through so many different places that matter to all kinds of different people.

I also love to walk and despite the slight inconvenience there is something quite free about the combination of train and legs to get me where I want to be.

I also love the space it forces into a commute. I've spent my train time doing lots of things:
- reading books
- finishing homework
- catching up with friends
- fielding messages and emails
- learning card tricks
- playing word games
- writing poetry and blogs
- vibing out to music as I watch the world lunge into frantic chase

Now trains (or specifically UK trains) aren't without their demerits. Frequent delays, and climbing prices do challenge its supremacy. Hopefully, I'll see the UK sort out its insane train system in my lifetime.

That's all for now.
