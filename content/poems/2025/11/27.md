{{< poem >}}
For all the little agonies of day,
Like crowding flowers marre an open field,
Until the beauty of the field is naught,
But petals there the true beauty in yield.

Why must I run so dry, my friend?
As fields become so plain?
I wish to see the flowers bloom,
But cower there in pain.

Surely I cannot bear these agonies,
Alone. My vigours crash down on my knees,
Surely a death must come my strength and prize,
To fall on barren fields that flowers rise.
