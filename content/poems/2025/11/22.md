{{< poem >}}
I'm taken with the archetypes,
The ancient molds and categories,
Unlearned in the ways yet leart,
From common plights and swarming dreams:
The glory in the open field and high country,
The shadow on the path smudging through darker trees,
The fierce hatred of raving beasts I fear to feed.
