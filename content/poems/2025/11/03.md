{{< poem >}}
From trickle to the rapid,
A day in many streams,
All drops turn weak and vapid,
But race like troubled dreams,

For leans on hands of time,
Are fraught with hidden pain,
Nothing shall stop to rhyme,
All things shall leave the same,

For in time's long unending reach,
To the divine eternity,
All slips away and drags to teach,
Are not man's arms too short to hold the time.
