{{< poem >}}
I should see in rain the call to home,
In you such things come heavy and so light,
Oh stage of all my thought and vacancy,
I am wistful and at times so sate.

Who should open up the skies of late,
And fill the stores with all such tears of care,
I am unworthy of time yet so,
Who could triumph over such a love.
