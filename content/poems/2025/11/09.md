{{< poem >}}
Such friendly shades are broken on the form,
What company in my undreary stoop,
I fashion evening old with frantic work,
All as a dimmness of the evening clings:

"O heady midnight oil alight,
The talk of all invasive dreams,
I am impressed upon the night,
You are impressed upon the seams,
And as the talk draws starkly strange,
The dreams are quickened - I must be to bed."
