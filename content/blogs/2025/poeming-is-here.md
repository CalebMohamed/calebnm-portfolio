If you aren't quite up to scratch in Caleb-land: poeming is [here][1].

I wrote about how I got into this crazy poetry business [in an
earlier blog][2], but I haven't shared much about my
reflections on the process.

Over the last month or so, I've been reformatting and tagging
with themes and series over 1000 of my past poems. That's a
lot of time, duds, and a few sparkling gems. It's been really wonderful
to take a wander and gander down memory lane through the lens
of my many musings. 

I'm happy with the current system of themes, series and
the archive navigation, but I plan to do more passes over the poems and
collate more complete tags. I've also been thinking about
how difficult it would be to add a feature where users can flag a poem
as one of the existing themes and give me a notification to review and
add it seamlessly.

Regardless, even this initial sporadic theming has lead to some
awesome insights into what I write about. I really seem to love
writing about [light][3]!

I've also reflected on how much I've appreciated this daily poetry
as an *artistic practice*. It leaves some cool artifacts, but it's also
valuable for how it has changed *me*. The loyalty to a craft. The 
meandering into self-expression. The wrestle with inspiration and 
dissatisfaction. I hope that it has made me more articulate, more 
reflective - hopefully - a better poet.

That's one of things I find so fascinating though. I've always seen
myself as someone who is a bit of a [corpus callosum][4], as Alex
O'Connor humorously called himself after mediating [a debate between
Richard Dawkins and Jordan Peterson][5]. As someone who appreciates a
good painting, who is enamored with people, who loves *the fluffier things* 
- maybe even someone who *makes art sometimes*.

Despite this, I've leant into the mechanical and inhuman with all my Greek 
symbols and abstract pursuits, becoming so joyfully lost in all the playful 
pedantry and wonderfully crafted riddles. Now though, after such a long period 
(maybe not long to the reader, but I'm only 19) of devoting myself 
to the practice, I can see myself as an artist - even as a poet. It's baffling 
to me that I would become a poet before becoming a computer scientist,
technologist, or theologian. I guess that's life for you.

Anyways, I hope you can find a practice too.
