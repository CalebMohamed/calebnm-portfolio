I long for worlds I never knew. 

Worlds in scribbled ink; on long winding tracks by the mountains;
in card and paper and such rich humanity.
It seems to me that so much good design is emulating old worlds:
the tactile feel of pen and paper, the clicks and thuds of mechanical doodads,
the low latency of real life. So much feels too clean and sterile in
my modern life.

I think that's why I've been drawn closer and closer to the terminal
and vim. It makes my interactions with the computer feel more tactile
and bare bones. The sprawling logs make it all feel much more wild
and enchanted. I like that all of the motions mean I'm feeling the
discrete clacks of keys more than the gliding of a mouse.

I get a nice little dose of this more tactile, embodied life when writing
out maths by hand. 


What is this longing. For what do I long.

I get a taste of it in handwritten mathematics. The tactile and the thoughtful. Its all too much.
