Welcome to the home of my personal projects! Here you'll find links to a
variety of pursuits: from poetry to graphics programming to random
research projects. Some say I am a man of too many passions. I fear
they are correct. :p

Anways, I hope you enjoy whatever you find. Most of the stuff is clickable
if you want to learn more!
